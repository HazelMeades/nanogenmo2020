Scapegoat

By Hazel Meades
 
Author's Note
I have just one quick thing to say: yes I have used a bit of my own life 
and inserted it into this novel. DON'T read into it. I want no analysts 
staring at this book and thinking "Is she saying what I think she's saying, 
or is there something more?" There is nothing more. Specifically: there's 
nothing I hate more than analysing so don't you dare do it to me. 
Acknowledgments
This is the first year I won NaNoWriMo. For those of you who don't 
know, that word stands for National Novel Writing Month. Due to the 
fact that I've written over 50,000 words all in November I think plenty of 
thanks are needed to the people who have helped me get through the 
month.
       Firstly thanks to the NaNoWriMo website and the people who 
make it work (even if it did have its off days and was alarmingly full at 
times) without you people I would have never been able to get to where 
I am now. The frequent pep talks, forum chats and videos were 
distracting at worst but inspiring at best which helped to make the 
challenge all the more fun. I'm sorry I couldn't donate to such a worthy 
cause but I'm 15 and still don't have a bank account.
       Secondly thanks to all my friends. Amy, I know you weren't too 
keen on the idea that we'd be doing it for the second year in a row, but 
you put up with the constant plot talk so thanks for that. As for the rest 
of you, you know who you are, thank you for the Skype chats every 
evening as we typed on with our novels. Similarly to the website you 
were encouraging, if distracting and it was always good to get feedback 
and to know that I wasn't alone in this huge task. I know my high word 
count was a bit intimidating at times and I apologise for that but you all 
pulled on through. I'm pretty proud of my fellow Wrimos. Thank you 
especially to Emily as I feel you've been very supportive through this 
time, if you were intimidated by my word count, you didn't seem to 
show it and for that I am grateful. 
       This year's writing was certainly good fun to research so I thank 
my parents for not looking at me too strangely when they saw the drug 
website on my laptop and for giving me plot ideas. Of course I mustn't 
forget to mention my brother in here. He put up with my constant 
begging for him to ask me any question about my story (in a vague hope 
to fuel its development). If I remember correctly I did that a lot.
       Generally I spent most of this year trying not to be a hypocrite. I 
remember last year's NaNo novel progress. All my writing buddies, 
including me, were insanely jealous of Tara's word count and never 
failed to mention it. She was a good sport with the sarcasm. However 
this year I've had to experience what that feels like so I was trying not to 
moan too much. I feel kind of guilty about laying it on so thick last year 
Tara, so thanks for putting up with that.
       All in all it was a busy month. I turned 15, had my first GCSE 
exam (I get my results in a few days' time!) and of course had to attend 
the regular business of school. It was not easy to find time for 
NaNoWriMo. I'm not quite sure how I managed to stay on target but 
somehow I did. I just prayed that I could keep it up, I know for a fact I'm 
not the only person with those difficulties but that doesn't mean we 
couldn't make it through the month. Someday we will all manage 
50,000. Go us! 
Prologue
"Oh my god!" screeched Cally. "I'm so sorry, it was an accident!"
It was a bit late for apologies now. 
Diane's body lay splayed out on the pavement, her guts wrenched from 
their original positions and her neck flexing at a disgustingly unnatural 
angle. Blood poured from her side like she was a glass being emptied; a 
dark black liquid dripped from her eyes and it trickled down her pale 
chin to form a small pool of the substance by her head. Her eyes which 
used to be as bright as sparklers on bonfire night were now a mushy 
brown colour, tainted by the foul liquid. 
       All in all the limp remains of the friend were a little too much to 
take in. Cally closed her eyes; she felt sick. Whether that was due to the 
gory state of her friend or the hysteria gripping her she did not know; it 
was probably a combination of the two. She remembered the laughter, 
the insanely high pitched giggling. The kind of noise that whined 
through the air in the most piercing of manners, the kind of sound that 
deserved to be locked up in a lunatic asylum and never let out, the kind 
of scare you were often startled by in horror films. Then Cally realised, it 
had been her. 
"Did I do this?" she murmured to herself frantically.
 She wanted to scream, she wanted to curse the world for what it had 
led her to, but most of all she needed a scapegoat, somewhere to shift 
all the blame. She leant on the wall beside her and shook off the 
dizziness. When Cally opened her eyes the first thing she saw was the 
dull grey walls of the car park. How typically atmospheric that her friend 
died in such a gloomy place! She glanced at the body and winced, it was 
thoroughly mutilated. Still leaning heavily on the wall she staggered 
around the corner and tried to hold down the bile that threatened to 
overpower her throat. Vomiting was not going to prove anything and 
neither was cradling the dead victim to her chest like they did in the 
movies. She banished the very thought from her head. This was real. 
After all, there was no doubt about it that Diane Metters was dead. 
"Cally? Cally! Where are you?!" cried a familiar voice.
The sound reverberated through the empty parking spaces. The worried 
voice was repeated a million times over in a rather creepy fashion. It 
took Cally several minutes to work out through the hazy fog of shock 
enveloping her that the voice belonged to her sister. Sure enough, 
Joanne raced around the corner of the grotty car park and as Cally laid 
eyes on her younger sister a small smirk crossed her face. This was just 
what she needed: a scapegoat.






























Chapter 1
Jo was simply glad to see her sister. She'd been concerned when Cally 
had left the party so early on, that wasn't like her. She usually drank till 
she dropped and then Jo had to face the trials of getting her home 
somehow. It was very difficult to keep their parents in the dark with 
Cally's drunken body language splurging all over the front couch as soon 
as they arrived. But this was not right; for once Cally hadn't had a drop 
of alcohol at the weekend. When she'd left Jo's concern had only 
deepened. Now she was glad that she had followed. Cally was in some 
state. 
       Her skin was as a pale as the bones beneath them and she clung 
to the wall as if it were a life support. Jo sprinted towards her and 
skidded to a halt.
"Cally what's wrong?"
Her sister let out an ear splitting laugh verging on hysterical before 
replying.
"What isn't?"
Jo winced slightly at the high pitched noise of her laughter and frowned 
as Cally clutched the wall again. 
"Let's get you home."
To be honest, her sister looked ill.
"I'm not letting you take me anywhere!" Cally screamed.
"What! Why?" Jo asked in bewilderment.
"IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!" Cally yelled into her sister's face. 
Jo closed her eyes and sighed. She was beginning to get annoyed.
"What is?" 
Cally pointed a quivering finger at the body behind her. Jo followed her 
sister's distraught gaze. She too spotted the disfigured corpse and 
screamed. She turned and joined Cally against the wall. She wasn't 
clinging onto it for support; she was simply trying to back away from the 
gruesome sight.
"Oh my god. Oh my god!" she whispered. "That's - that's Diane!"
"Yep."
Jo stuttered; lost for words to describe the sudden ache she felt in her 
heart and the sick feeling in her stomach. They both knew Diane well; 
she was Cally's best friend for a reason and Jo got on with her too. She 
gave far better advice than her older sister did. Cally and Di had gone to 
primary school together. Now they were in year 11. Emphasis on the 
were. But of course, all of that was over now. Jo gulped for a few 
seconds trying to form words to express the impact it had on her but all 
she could do was gasp panicked questions. Her mind felt hollow. In this 
case that meant completely devoid of the ability to construct full 
sentences.
"What did she-how did she - ?"
"How should I know? All I know is that it's all your fault." said Cally in a 
surprisingly calm voice, considering what she had just witnessed.
Jo stared at her sister wondering why she was accusing her of all 
people! She'd only just found the body. Then again, they were both in 
shock and Cally was not exactly in a sound state of mind at the moment. 
"How is this my fault?!" Jo spluttered.
"It just is." Cally confirmed.
Jo tried to ignore her sister's frustrating persistence and dropped the 
subject.
"We should call the police."
"NO."
Jo frowned in confusion. Why did her sister not want the police to know 
about this disturbing death?
"Cal they can help find out who did this to Di. They can punish them." Jo 
pointed out.
"Just don't." she said, pausing for a minute before adding "Do you want 
to be put in jail?"
Jo growled, there Cally went again blaming her younger sibling for all 
her problems. Even in horribly disturbing, life changing moments such 
as this her older sister found a way to blame Jo for everything. She 
swallowed her anger and put her hand on Cally's shoulder. Much to Jo's 
surprise she noted that her sister was shivering. Her anger lessened a 
little. 
"Listen to me, this is not my fault. How could I have done this?" she 
asked soothingly.
"You make me sick." replied Cally backing away.
She violently thrust Jo's hand off of her shoulder. Her sister cradled her 
hand, Cally didn't know her own strength but Jo did.
"Did you even see what happened?" Jo asked sceptically.
"It only takes one witness to prove that you're guilty."
Cally sounded so - for lack of a better word - confident when she said 
that; despite her faint, strangely peaceful tone. As soon as the thought 
crossed Jo's mind she was alarmed to see her sister do a perfect eye roll 
and slump backwards onto the wall by her side. Her head knocked 
gently against the hard concrete as she collapsed and her arms drooped 
limply to her sides, trapping the one she'd been using to stay upright. It 
was not the most graceful faint Jo had ever seen, but she couldn't care 
less.  She ran over to Cally, knelt beside her and started to panic further 
although that was barely possible by this point.
"Cal? Can you hear me?" 
She slapped her sister's face like she'd seen actors do in soap operas, 
but just like the TV shows it was not very effective. She drew her hand 
away to find it coated in cold sweat from Cally's cheeks. She wiped it off 
on her jeans in disgust. Jo reached for her mobile ready to dial 999 just 
like her sister had warned her not to. After all, neither of them ever did 
as they were told. It seemed to run in the family; or at least, her 
mother's side. 
       The beeps the touchscreen made rang out loudly in the silent 
car park. Jo glared at the phone, wishing she knew how to change the 
settings to a quieter one. But the sound of footsteps stopped her mid-
dial. They echoed through the lonely car park.
"Who's there?" she called.
It was only afterwards that Jo remembered it probably wasn't good to 
announce her whereabouts to the world when there was most likely a 
killer on the loose somewhere in the car park. She gave herself a good 
mental kicking and waited to see if there was a reply. 
Nothing.
The footsteps appeared to have stopped for the moment. Jo waited but 
all that remained was silence. She shook her head. Maybe she'd 
imagined it? Yes, that had to be it. It'd better be it otherwise she and 
Cally were dead meat. She glanced down at her phone. All she needed 
to dial was one more number. Then the footsteps rang out again. She 
dropped the phone onto her lap in shock. Fortunately the material of 
her jeans muted the phone's thud unlike the pavement would've done. 
Jo thanked god that she hadn't been able to dial the final number; the 
frustratingly loud beep would've lead the quiet stranger straight to 
them. All the same the footsteps were approaching. Every second they 
got nearer. Finally Jo decided she couldn't just sit here in fear and wait 
for this person to brutally murder them. She put away her phone, 
grabbed her sister's arms and attempted to drag her unconscious body 
to her feet with little success at first. After a few more tries and rude 
hand gestures that she knew she'd only be able to get away with when 
Cally was out cold Jo finally had some luck. Cally was standing. Well, 
drooping by the younger sibling's side. Jo moved in front of her sister 
and let her fall gently onto her back. She hitched her arms round her 
sides so Cally was now held in place and crept to the side of the wall. 
The coast was clear. For the moment. The steps drew nearer. Jo slowly 
walked towards the other side of the car park. Every step was a 
struggle: she had to judge her speed, strength and noise carefully in 
order to escape from this budding nightmare. Her body screamed at her 
to run but her mind told her to relax. If she ran she'd drop Cally, plus it 
would give her away to this murderer, whoever the git was. Jo started 
to count her steps in an attempt to focus on her progress, rather than 
panic. Left, right, one, two, step, step. The steady rhythm seemed to 
calm her slightly but not enough to make her forget the danger she and 
her sister were in. They had to get out of here before it was too late. If 
the stranger caught up to them - if they didn't make it - if that person 
realised - 
	Soon she was by the door. Jo turned to scan the car park one 
last time. As she analysed the distance she had just travelled she was 
amazed that she managed to make it this far. Carrying her heavy sister 
in what was effectively a piggy back position took a lot of effort. She 
shrugged in response to her thoughts, adrenaline did amazing things.
"Goodbye Di." she whispered.
She lugged Cally over to the lift. They were currently on level three; the 
sooner they made it out of the disturbing hell hole the better. She 
pressed the button and waited. It took a painful amount of time for the 
lift to arrive and Jo could feel the panic threatening to overwhelm her. 
Diane is dead. I've just seen a dead body. Her thoughts were like a stuck 
record. She simply couldn't comprehend what had just happened. 
Suddenly she felt tired and sagged under the weight of her sister. That 
was when the lift arrived, just in the nick of time. Jo fell through the 
open doors and dumped Cally on the floor. She pressed the ground floor 
button and sank down beside her sister. Cally was pretty heavy. Putting 
her down felt like a weight had been taken off of her shoulders - in this 
case literally.
	Jo felt herself relax a tiny bit, they were safe. Her stomach 
lurched as the lift jerked into motion. She closed her eyes briefly and 
took a deep breath. She was exhausted. Jo felt drained both physically 
and emotionally but she had to make one last call. It couldn't wait. Jo 
grabbed her phone and dialled the final nine.
"Hello?" she said hesitantly.
"Which service do you require?" asked a cool female voice.
"Erm... police." said Jo and then glanced at her sister. "On second 
thoughts make that an ambulance as well. My sister has collapsed and - 
and we just found a body."
"Okay." acknowledged the voice. Jo could tell that this person was 
trained to remain calm and professional. It was no comfort to the caller 
if the person on the receiving end was equally distressed. She felt 
slightly ashamed that she herself was so scared. "Where are you?"
"In a lift, but that's not important. Diane is up on the third floor of the 
London National car park."
"I'm sorry, who is Diane?"
"She's the person who's d-dead." Jo stuttered slightly on the final word 
unable to admit it to herself. "I - I couldn't stay up there. I heard 
footsteps and I think it was the person who killed her. Whoever it was 
would've got us if I hadn't -" she trailed off as her mind began to 
conduct vivid imagery concerning the possibilities of 'what if'.
"Okay, please get yourself out of the building. The police will be right 
with you."
"Thank you." said Jo.
She started to sob, the trauma finally breaking through.
"Is there anybody I can call for you?"
"Call my mum please." Jo pleaded and started to recite her mother's 
phone number.
There was a pause. For a minute Jo thought that she'd shaken the lady 
but she decided that it couldn't be that. The woman was simply busy 
calling her mother. Several minutes passed and she cried into the 
phone. Eventually the lift jolted to a stop. "I've got to go." she said to 
the lady and with that she hung up and dragged her sister out by the 
arms, no longer afraid of making loud noises. 
	She rested Cally so she was sitting up, supported by the wall 
behind her. As she made it to the pavement Jo realised that the majority 
of her panic had faded during the lift journey, now all that remained 
was the pain. Tears trickled down her cheeks like miniature waterfalls. 
Despite their size they were every bit as gushing as the real thing. She 
leant back on the wall of the car park entrance and put her face in her 
hands. She cried openly as she tried not to remember what had just 
happened. Strangely enough the thing that upset her the most was the 
fact that her sister had blamed her for it all. How dare she! 
       Jo glared down through the film of tears at her unconscious 
sibling. What was she even doing in that car park in the first place? All of 
a sudden Cally had just snuck off for no reason whatsoever. Jo sniffed. 
Cally usually stuck around for the drinks. She groaned internally as she 
remembered something vital. The lady on the phone had called her 
mum and contacted the police for her. Everything about their weekend 
parties was going to come out in the open. That could be awkward. 
       Jo sighed. Cally loved a good drink and made the most of it 
when she could get one. The parties were her idea, but Jo came along of 
her accord. Cally never forced her into anything. She knew that in her 
parent's eyes they'd think she was just as bad as her sister. Jo enjoyed a 
drink from time to time plus she wanted to keep an eye on her "oh so 
independent" sibling. Cally had a knack for getting herself into unusual 
scrapes, mainly due to what people could manipulate her into when she 
was drunk. Despite being younger than her sister Jo felt she was way 
more mature. Cally simply needed a chaperone. However Jo knew that 
no matter what happened part of the blame was going to fall on her for 
not telling anyone. It wasn't like she'd never told anyone, in fact she'd 
been instructed to invite her friends but she knew that if she used that 
excuse in an argument her mother would only grow angrier. She got 
angry enough with the sisters without the extra baggage of what they 
got up to at the weekends. 
       The sound of a siren cut through Jo's trail of thought and she 
was glad, if she wasn't careful she'd start thinking about her parents. 
That was never a good subject to dwell on. A police car swerved round 
the bend and screeched to a stop. Uniformed men got out from the car, 
one giving orders to the rest before coming over to the sisters. On 
closer inspection Jo realised that this person was actually a woman. She 
felt herself go red. But then again with the lady's hair tucked up in her 
hat like that how was anybody meant to tell what gender she was from 
the back?
"What's your name kid?" she asked.
Jo was still crying but managing to keep her sobbing to a minimum in 
order to respond.
"Jo. That's my sister Cally." she responded nodding in her sister's 
direction.
"You two need to stay put. My men are going to check out the building."
"Okay."
Jo glanced at her sister, staying put for once would not be so tricky. The 
policewoman caught her sideways glance and her expression softened.
"Don't worry; an ambulance is going to arrive soon. But for now you 
need to wait." The lady turned and yelled a command. "Rory can you 
keep an eye on these two for me?"
Rory did not look too pleased about having to babysit but walked over 
all the same. He reminded Jo a lot of Cally when she was in a sulk. Her 
sister was renowned for her spectacular sulking skills; Jo admired it from 
a distance as it generally meant that Cally was in a bad mood for weeks.
"Fine." he agreed reluctantly.
"Don't give me that look. If this girl is right there's a murderer up there, 
you owe me. I want you on your best behaviour." 
The man curbed the urge to roll his eyes and nodded meekly instead. 
The woman turned and directed the other policemen into the car park. 
As soon as she was out of sight Rory started grumbling.
"I swear she's doing this on purpose." he muttered to himself. "Why 
couldn't Greg babysit? He's even good with kids! I swear she's-"
"I'm fourteen." interrupted Jo, angry at being referred to like she was a 
toddler. "I'm not a baby."
Rory looked affronted. 
"Who said you could talk?"
Jo rolled her eyes.
"Who said I couldn't? My point is I don't need someone to look after 
me."
"Well it's just as well you have someone anyways. People with that 
attitude find themselves needing help the most." 
If this was said by any other person it may have sounded like an insult, 
but this policeman sounded grim and slightly sad. It reminded Jo that 
she was a kid and he was an adult. He was only keeping an eye on her as 
instructed.
"Sorry. It's been one hell of an evening." Jo apologised wiping her eyes 
with her sleeve.
Rory looked slightly bewildered.
"Now I've seen everything, an apologetic teenager?" Jo frowned at his 
stereotyping but decided not to comment. "What was it exactly that 
happened in there?"
"You mean you came out here but you didn't know?"
"That pretty much sums it up."
Jo found herself going over the story, delving into such detail that Rory 
shuddered as she described the body.
"O-okay I'm sorry for belittling you can you please stop with the gore?!" 
he spluttered after Jo had gone on a tangent about the angle of Diane's 
neck.
She gave him a watery smile and moved on. Despite his initial ignorance 
to the ways of teen-kind he seemed surprisingly good at listening. By 
the time she'd finished the ambulance arrived and she was distracted by 
the medics attending to her sister. They needed to know how long Cally 
had been out for and details like that. Jo went on autopilot from there 
on and Rory left her to it.
***
The policewoman emerged from the entrance. 
"There's a body up there. Pretty mutilated."
"Tell me about it." 
The lady frowned but decided to leave it.
"Did you get anything out of her?"
"Everything - a little too much if anything. I think she needed to vent."
She smiled. 
"Well that's something. I know you are our newest recruit but you're 
the best interrogator I've ever met." she said warmly. Rory grinned at 
the praise. "I just hope for your sake that the stuff you were mumbling 
earlier about me was part of the act." 
His smile abruptly faded. He hoped that the lady was joking but it was 
virtually impossible to tell with this woman. She smirked and went to 
talk to the medics leaving Rory slightly lost for words.
	 "How is she?" asked the policewoman.
"Still out cold, but she'll live." replied the nurse. "There were a few 
other things worth noting about her symptoms however, we'll need to 
take her to hospital to do a few tests which we can't do without 
parental consent."
"Their mother has been contacted, she'll be here soon. Don't leave until 
she's arrived." she informed the medics. "How long will we have to wait 
before we can interrogate her properly?" 
The medic looked slightly shocked at the suggestion. She had to remind 
herself that the kids had been at the site of a murder most brutal 
although Rory described it as yucky when he examined the pictures 
later.
"At least a day. Never mind the tests, those kids will need a little time to 
get over the physiological trauma of seeing the remains of a good 
friend."
"They have two hours."
The nurse's mouth fell open. It didn't take a genius to realise that 
timescale was ridiculous.
"But-" began the woman.
"My husband died, I got over it." 
"In two hours?" said the nurse dubiously.
For a moment the strong policewoman seemed broken. For a minute 
the nurse saw through the cracks in her disguise and the defiant lady 
before her seemed depressed and downtrodden. But soon the hood of 
the disguise was back up.
"In less." retorted the policewoman and with that she strode off 
towards the curb.
She pretended to be looking at the photos but was really keeping an eye 
for the girls' mother in an attempt to distract herself from the thoughts 
of her late husband. The sooner the mother arrived the better, the 
policewoman wanted to get this case done and over with. She felt her 
stomach twist at she glanced briefly at the gruesome photo in her hand. 
This case felt all too familiar. But then again, her thoughts were never 
straight with Michael on the brain.
	Thankfully the sound of screeching tyres brought the 
policewoman out of her reverie. A red Peugeot squealed to a halt by the 
roadside and a woman in her mid-thirties stepped out from the car. Her 
striking red hair dangled down her concerned face as she raced over to 
the ambulance.
"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?" she shouted.
The policewoman frowned; this was obviously the girls' mother. The 
likeness between her and Jo was clear already, as they both shared the 
vibrant auburn hair tones. She could see Jo trying and failing to explain 
what had taken place in the car park. The girl looked genuinely scared, 
more so than she'd been when the policewoman had first seen her. 
Rory who had also been watching this exchange decided he should go 
over to calm things down a bit. The last thing Jo needed was her 
mother's yells giving her an earful.
"Please calm down Miss." he said nipping over to the ambulance.
"CALM DOWN? ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS IS UNCONSCIOUS!" 
"I know it's a lot to take in-"
"THAT'S A BIT OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT!"
"I will explain everything right here and now if you'll shut up for a 
second. If you want to keep your other daughter from collapsing the 
least you can do is stop yelling." said Rory, a hint of irritation creeping 
into his voice.
The mother's chest swelled up, she heightened herself slightly, her face 
reddened and Rory winced in preparation for her rage to overflow. But 
much to everyone's surprise she enveloped Jo in a tight hug. Jo was 
equally shocked; she managed to force a smile as she peeped over her 
mother's shoulder. At such a close proximity it was only her who could 
hear the sigh of relief the woman emitted.
"Mum I can't breathe." Jo gasped.
"Oh. Sorry darling." She let go. Jo massaged her arms where her 
mother's grip had cut off the blood circulation. The woman turned to 
face Rory. "Explain."
"Well we got an emergency call from - what is your name Miss?"
"Aileen." she replied impatiently rolling her eyes at the question.
Jo however could see through her act. Her mother was annoyed on the 
outside but on the inside she was just relieved that her daughters were 
okay. Well, in some respects. Jo could also tell that Aileen was enjoying 
Rory's obvious nervousness around her. The policeman started to 
launch into an explanation and as he did so the policewoman in charge 
strolled over casually to join them. However halfway through his 
account of the story Jo had told him they were interrupted by a medic 
who wanted to talk to the police.
"Now the girl's mother -" 
"Her name is Cally." interrupted Aileen.
"Now Cally's mother -"
"My name is Aileen."
Jo smiled slightly. Despite everything her mother had still retained the 
ability to be extraordinarily difficult; she was spectacular at winding 
people up. Not so different from a certain sister she knew. Although 
many people told her she was the mirror image of her mother Jo knew 
that Cally acted a lot more like her: a hothead with an attitude of her 
own.
"Anyways, now you're here Aileen we need your consent to run Cally 
through a few tests once we arrive at the hospital."
"You've got it."
On hearing this news the policewoman felt she ought to intervene.
"Aileen, you do realise that when your second daughter is conscious we 
will need to interrogate her."
"Can't you give her some breathing space?" argued Jo's mother.
"Do you understand me?" 
Something authoritive in the policewoman's voice seemed to take 
Aileen by surprise and she found herself replying meekly.
"Yes."
"Call us when she's awake."
And with that the police officers stepped back, the double doors of the 
ambulance closed and Jo found herself being whisked away from the 
scene of a crime.
***
After the Doctor's verdict Cally had to stay at the hospital. As Aileen 
drove her other daughter home there was an awkward silence in the 
car. It was rather stifling in fact. Being the mother Aileen felt she ought 
to say something, but was unsure of what. After all, she was every bit as 
upset as Jo. On the bright side she hadn't known Diane too well. Except 
for the occasional play date with the girls she'd never really met the 
friend properly. Plus Jo had finally stopped crying. As for Cally, she'd be 
fine. She had to. She was a strong girl. Her occasional tantrums proved 
that much at least.
"It's going to be okay." she murmured in what she hoped was a 
reassuring voice. 
Jo nodded but said nothing. Normally Cally filled up this silent space 
with her loud chatter. Without her the car felt empty. 
	Both mother and daughter were relieved when they arrived at 
home. But the house seemed haunted by Cally's absence. Jo jumped 
when the doorbell rang. It was probably a friend from the party 
wondering where she'd got to, making a house call to check that she 
wasn't chickening out of another night out. It wouldn't be the first time.
"I'll get it!" Jo called and ran to the door. She was glad for the intrusion; 
anything that would take her mind off everything else was welcome. 
However when she opened it she was surprised to find Cally's boyfriend 
standing at their doorstep. "Dolph? What are you doing here?"
"Wouldn't you like to know!" he sneered. "Where's Cally?"
"I'm not telling you until you tell me why you're here." Jo retorted. 
She had never particularly liked her sister's taste in men. This boyfriend 
was a few years older than Cally and was in sixth form. The age 
difference wasn't what bothered her however.
"She disappeared from the party."
"You only just noticed?" Jo said raising an eyebrow.
"Well yeah, she promised that afterwards we'd -" he paused. "never 
mind."
Jo sighed. As far as she was concerned Dolph was a jerk. Sure he was 
hot, with his spiked up black hair and chocolate coloured eyes, but looks 
aren't everything. He was the classic bad boy stereotype you read about 
in books and who were littered in clichéd films, the type who only 
wanted one thing. One thing that wasn't even legal at the age of fifteen 
for his girlfriend.
"So you came down here to find her. How touching." she remarked 
mockingly.
"Yep, so where is she?" he responded totally missing Jo's sarcasm.
"She's at the hospital Dolphin." she replied using the nickname she 
loved to taunt him with.
He glared at the use of it but ignored her.
"What's she doing there?" he asked stupidly.
Jo analysed his facial expression in amusement. It was a cross between a 
pained look, a worried one and the gormless expression usually present 
on his face.
"Getting better."
"She seemed fine at the party."
"Well she wasn't afterwards. Goodbye Dolph."
Jo started to shut the door on him but he put his foot inbetween her 
and the door as it closed. He winced in pain as it slammed against his 
foot and hopped away from the doorstep clutching it.
"Please Jo; I have to know if she's okay. I'm her boyfriend." he pleaded.
She sighed. Maybe Dolph did love Cally but he had one hell of a way to 
show it. She opened the door a tiny bit wider so she could see him 
through the gap.
"I don't know if she's okay."
"But you said-" 
"I don't know Dolph!" Jo snapped.
"Great. So much for tonight." he said and stormed off.
"If you want to see her so much why don't you go to the hospital?" Jo 
called after him.
"She can't kiss me if she's sick." 
On hearing this Jo slammed the door properly. 
	She raced upstairs to her bedroom. Her mother watched her in 
confusion and followed. Aileen poked her head round the door and saw 
her daughter crying into her pillow with a fresh set of tears. She didn't 
know how to deal with this. Cally she understood. When she was angry, 
frustrated or upset she threw things and lashed out at everybody 
around her. However Jo was a lot more like her father. If she felt any 
one of those emotions instead of exploding she'd implode until the 
feelings came rushing out of her bottled up insides. In Jo's case it was in 
the form of tears. In her father's case it had been leaving. Aileen 
decided to leave her daughter to it, if she said anything she had a feeling 
she'd only make it worse. She knew she wasn't the best mother in the 
world. So generally she left her kids to do what they wanted unless it 
was something bad or stupid like smoking. The mother walked away 
from her daughter's bedroom and went back downstairs to get on with 
filling out her divorce papers.
	Meanwhile Dolph was on his way to the hospital. It wasn't too 
far a walk from Cally's house. He had decided that maybe Jo was right. 
Despite her irritating way of putting things (especially his name) there 
was a certain depth of reasoning behind most of it. Cally lacked that. A 
lot of what she said made little sense to him but she was beautiful and 
she was his which made up for it. He owed it to her as her boyfriend to 
go visit, maybe if he was lucky he'd get a sympathy snog for all the 
effort he'd made to walk over. He grinned at the thought of that before 
remembering his counter argument for not visiting in the first place. If 
Cally had some kind of disease maybe she could pass it on to him? He 
hoped she didn't. That could put a real downer on their relationship. 
He'd have to start seeing other people. 
	Finally Dolph arrived at the hospital ward. He was a little unsure 
of what to do or say; despite his bad boy reputation he hadn't visited 
the place since he was born. He walked awkwardly through the white 
entrance halls. The colours were all one blinding shade as you'd expect 
at such a place. Finally he came across a white reception. He was 
surprised by how far away it was from the entrance. He pushed up to 
the front of the queue much to most people's annoyance and waited 
patiently for the receptionist to finish on the phone. Eventually the 
woman hung up and turned to face him. Fortunately for Dolph the 
woman hadn't seen him push in and ignored the loud grumblings 
behind him, taking it as the people simply complaining at how slow the 
line was today. After all, the hospital was extremely busy.
"Hello how can I help you?" she said, looking slightly worn out by 
today's amount of visitors.
"Erm...I want to see Cally Sanders."
"Okay," the woman started to flip through a list of names next to her. 
"What injury does she have?"
"I don't know."
The lady paused.
"You don't know?"
"Her sister wouldn't tell me anything useful." Dolph replied groaning at 
the memory.
"How are you related to this patient?"
"I'm not. I'm her boyfriend. I need to see her."
"I'm sorry but at the moment its family visits only for that girl." she said. 
"This place is crowded enough as it is." she muttered quietly to herself.
"Look lady I need to see her!"
"Well you can't."
Dolph slammed his hand down on the desk in anger. The receptionist 
barely flinched. The people behind him however jumped.
"I am practically family!"
"Do I need to call security?" she sighed, a slightly bored tone to her 
voice.
"Quite possibly." he muttered and skulked off. He headed up the stairs 
despite the receptionist's warning. "Looks like I'm just going to have to 
find her myself."
Now that Dolph had made the effort to get here, he was determined to 
actually see his girlfriend.
	The place was a maze filled with twisting white corridors. At the 
very least the wards were labelled but Dolph found this was not enough 
to make his way round the hospital. What he really needed was a "you 
are here" map. After a considerable amount of time wandering, asking 
for directions and having tired feet he found Cally. Or rather, she found 
him. 
"Dolph!" she cried in surprise. 
"Ah." he said, turned round and rushed over to her. He frowned. "You 
don't look too good."
"Well duh, I'm in a hospital bed." Cally pointed out. "It's good to see 
you, have you brought me anything?"
Dolph paused to think of an excuse for not bringing her something, one 
which didn't suggest that he simply didn't care enough about her to be 
bothered. He knew that would be what her sister would say.
"I only just found out!" he said. "Give me a break."
"Well, you came and that's the main thing."
Cally patted the bedside. Dolph sat down and attempted to snuggle up 
to her as much as he could. It was not the easiest job, but perhaps if he 
pretended to enjoy cuddling he'd get a little more than that. Cally 
giggled. 
"You know you said that after the party -"  he began.
Her smile abruptly faded. 
"Dolph, look at me. I'm not exactly in the state for it now." He looked at 
her reluctantly and couldn't help but agree. "I'm tired. Aren't you even 
curious about what happened?"
Dolph glanced at the room around the hospital bed. It told him 
everything he needed to know.
"All I can tell is that it made you upset."
There was a trail of broken things littered throughout the room. It was 
one of the clear tell-tale signs that Cally was unhappy. He knew from 
experience.
"You know me so well." she sighed, completely unaware of the mess 
around her.
Then again, she didn't remember making much of it. The doctors had 
had to sedate her after that particular outburst.
"So what happened?" asked Dolph, a hint of frustration added to his 
voice.
 He'd come up here for a reason but it looked like Cally wasn't in the 
mood. He wished she'd follow up on her promise; every time he 
brought it up she put it off. This time round he had thought that maybe 
things would be different - apparently not. 
"Jo killed Diane."
Dolph squinted in an attempt to remember who Diane was. He hadn't 
been with Cally for that long and he preferred not to fraternise with the 
friends.
"Is Diane that girl who hangs around with you at school and is always 
saying shit about me like your sister?"
"Yeah."
Dolph was tempted to say good riddance, it was certainly what he was 
thinking but he had a feeling that wouldn't go down too well with his 
girlfriend. He groaned. He really hated patience. Cally took it for a 
sympathetic groan.
"What did she do that for?"
"How am I supposed to know?" she snapped. 
"She's your sister!"
"I guess."
"How can you be unsure of whether she's your sister!? Is she actually 
adopted?" Dolph asked.
Cally laughed, assuming it was a joke. He frowned. If it was a joke it was 
completely unintentional. All the same he decided to go along with it 
and laughed along with her.
"I just meant she's so unlike me it's difficult to imagine we are family." 
She grinned slightly at their misunderstanding. "You always know how 
to cheer me up."
"I'm not surprised it was Jo who killed her, she can be pretty mean." he 
added.
"Yeah. She's so judgemental! She's always keeping an eye on me - like I 
can't look after myself and she never even tries to appreciate my 
brilliant boyfriends." Dolph frowned at the plural of boyfriends but said 
nothing. "That was the one thing that me and Diane argued about: my 
choice in men. Jo is so good at turning people against me. It's not fair. I 
know for a fact that you care about me." Cally said.
Dolph smiled, this was the perfect opportunity. He leaned towards her. 
Their faces were barely an inch apart.
"I second that."
Then he started to kiss her. Cally's eyes widened in surprise but she 
began to kiss him back too. He moved his hand down her back slowly 
but the call of a doctor made them stop.
"What are you doing here?"
Dolph glanced behind him and groaned. This was just typical. 
"Dolph? Didn't the receptionist let you up?" Cally asked, curious as to 
the doctor's surprise at the presence of her boyfriend.
 "Okay so I sort of snuck in, so what? I needed to see you babe."
A beaming smile covered her face at the use of the 'b'word. 
"You snuck in just for me?"
But this exchange had the doctor striding towards them.
"Got to go. Love you later." Dolph said. 
He felt mildly disappointed. What a dismal visit! It had been rather 
dreary and it seemed like the only thing Cally wanted to talk about were 
her feelings. What about his? He walked all the way over to visit her and 
barely got a mention. But footsteps reminded him that he had other 
things to focus on.
       Dolph span around on the spot to face the doctor looming over 
him. He was a rather tall man, with an overbearing moustache that 
made his head look tiny in proportion to the rest of his body. Dolph 
ducked past the man's arm and made a race for the exit. He thought he 
could hear footsteps chasing after him so he made a mad dash for the 
silent ward he'd been in earlier. Nobody was allowed to make any noise 
in there. He ran through the corridor ignoring the shushes coming at 
him from people in all directions down in the ward. He could hear the 
doctor's footsteps fade to a stop. Dolph felt rather smug and slowed to 
a walk at the end of the corridor, to tease the man in the white coat 
further. Then he glanced behind him. The doctor was speed-walking 
with an angry but determined look on his face. Dolph started to run 
again however the doctor had the advantage of knowing his way around 
the hospital properly whilst Dolph was simply guessing. He felt a little 
like he was going round in circles. He was trying to find the route he'd 
used to come up in the first place. After what felt like ages (and 
probably was) he found the staircase he'd climbed up initially and raced 
down it. As he reached the ground floor of the hospital the receptionist 
who'd denied him entrance to see Cally in the first place noticed him.
"What are you still doing here?" she called.
Wasn't it obvious? Dolph thought to himself. He was running.
"Running." he yelled to her. 
The receptionist glared at him, sighed to herself and started to call 
security. Dolph sped up considerably.
***
Rory knew it was getting late but he had to finish this report. He hated 
being stuck in the office, but it wasn't like he had anything better to do. 
He sighed and continued to write things up. He knew he wasn't terribly 
good at it but the woman in charge always left him with this work. He 
swore that she did it on purpose but couldn't really prove anything 
much to his annoyance. Rory glanced at his superior's office. It was 
empty. So why was the light on? He sighed and went to turn it off but as 
he opened the door he saw the policewoman asleep with her head on 
the desk. Her brown hair that was normally tied into a neat bun 
cascaded over her face. She looked peaceful when she was asleep, 
instead of the strict woman she was during the day. He'd never really 
noticed it before but with her hair down she looked - pretty. However 
the circles under her eyes detracted from that a bit. There was a cup of 
coffee on her desk. As he entered she awoke suddenly, jumping up from 
her seat.
"Oh. It's just you."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. I didn't realise you were still in here 
in fact."
"Why are you still in the department? It's close to midnight."
Rory wanted to ask her the same question.
"I had to finish off that report." he explained dangling the paper in front 
of her face. "It's still not done yet."
"Oh. Right. Well, I can do that. You go home and get some sleep; it's 
been a busy day. I want you ready for tomorrow."
"Alright then. If you're sure..."
"I'm sure."
The policewoman took the paper from his hand. 
"Thanks." said Rory, mildly surprised by his superior's behaviour.




















Chapter 2
He felt that he caught her in a vulnerable moment and it was quite a 
bizarre feeling. He started to leave but halfway out of the door he 
turned.
"Yes Rory?"
"Linda -" He paused realising his mistake. Nobody ever called her by her 
first name. He moved on quickly hoping to detract from it. "are you 
okay?"
"I'm fine." she assured him with a tired smile. "And if you ever use my 
name again I'll see to it that you get demoted."
Rory left the room abruptly. He knew he was lucky to get off with that 
warning.
	She smiled after him. He was a good policeman. She liked him 
more than she'd care to admit, especially to herself. Not that she'd ever 
let him know she thought of him that way. He made dumb mistakes 
sometimes, but generally ones that couldn't be helped. 
       One that could've been helped however was the time he 
arrested a five year old for murder. That was back when he'd only just 
become a policeman. When she had come to investigate it turned out 
that the kid was just trying to make a dramatic tea party through killing 
off her dolls. It was a rather embarrassing mistake but you'd think that 
the man would know better than to listen to the word of a five year old 
and take her seriously without a pinch of salt. She'd covered for him 
that day, because she liked him. Linda thought Rory had potential and 
just needed a little experience to prove her right. As a result he owed 
her which came in handy from time to time. But the best part was that 
Linda had been right. She loved it when that happened.
       Anyways she needed to get this report done. Tiredness was no 
excuse although she often wished it was. She hated today's case. Not 
only was it disgusting but the death rang true. This wasn't the first 
person to die in such an aggravatingly horrible way. The sooner they 
could interrogate that other girl the better. They needed information if 
they wanted to catch this killer. Linda sighed and read over what Rory 
had written so far. He'd barely got half way through the story of the day 
but at least what he had said was thorough instead of the ramblings she 
sometimes received in reports. That was one of the main reasons why 
she chose Rory to write these things out. What he wrote made a certain 
amount of sense. He was able to get his head around things. Linda knew 
she'd always been rubbish at this but started to write all the same. 
Something had to go down on the paper, whether she liked it or not. 
They needed to catch this vile hooligan and unfortunately for her every 
detail was important.
        She picked up the photos attached by paperclip to the report 
and looked at them. This was the worst murder victim picture she'd 
seen in a long time. It made her shudder. Linda started to write. Slowly 
but surely the words tumbled onto the page. It wasn't exactly how she 
wanted things to be conveyed but she knew that no matter how gory 
the image a little description had to be provided. She rushed through 
the report and read it through to check the content. Her internal editor 
cringed. The difference between what she'd written and what Rory had 
done was painfully clear. But it would have to do. She read through it a 
second time, this time to check spellings. She'd once been given a 
report that misspelt the word capture. Silly mistakes like that were 
embarrassing to look back on and awkward to hand in. Since she was 
tired she knew that she'd probably made plenty of spelling mistakes. 
She sipped her coffee and started to look back through it but noise 
outside her office distracted her. The light had been turned on. She 
frowned and put down the paper. She walked out of her office.
"Hello?"
"Hi." said Rory. He looked worried. "I think I left my house key here."
Linda restrained herself from laughing. Instead she responded with a 
simple comment.
"Clever." 
Rory glared at her. 
"I didn't do it on purpose."
He started to search his desk for them. She felt a bit guilty that she was 
just standing there. 
"Do you need a hand?"
"Yes please." he replied.
"What does it look like?"
Rory gave her a look.
"Like a key."
Linda rolled her eyes and joined him on her hands and knees to find it.
"I see you still have to finish my report." he commented, attempting to 
make light conversation whilst they searched. She nodded. "Maybe I'm 
not the only person who needs to go home and get some sleep."
"No, I need to get this done."
"Linda how are you meant to focus on anything if you're tired enough to 
fall asleep in your office? It's a big day tomorrow. We'll be interrogating 
the other girl."
She was too tired to notice the way Rory was using her own words 
against her.
"She's awake?"
"You're obviously not. I used your first name. Aren't you going to 
demote me?"
"Oh." 
She rubbed her eyes. Maybe he was right. Then her eyes widened as she 
caught a glimpse of dull grey metal. Rory noticed her reaction.
"What is it?"
Linda reached under the desk carefully, laying down on her belly and 
then dragged her arm back. Her hand was clutching the key. She sat up.
"Look what I found." she said proudly. She dangled the key in front of 
his face teasingly. "I'm not tired enough to miss what's right in front of 
me."
He tried to snatch them off her but she jerked away.
"Come on!" he moaned. "Of all the times to act like a kid you choose 
now?"
"I'm not hyper; I'm on a caffeine high which has just hit. That's how I 
stay awake half of the time. Now catch me if you can!" He rolled his 
eyes. "Do you want your key or not?" she added before racing off into 
the darkness of the police department. 
Rory grinned a little despite himself and chased after her.
	It was just those two officers left in the entire place. It was silent 
apart from their footsteps. Rory could only imagine the shocked looks 
on the other policemen's faces if they were here to witness this truly 
remarkable event: the event of Linda relaxing a little. When she wasn't 
being strict she was busy with work, when that wasn't the problem 
something else always managed to get in the way. He had to admit that 
it was good to see her happy, even if it was only for a few minutes 
because of a caffeine high. 
       Rory raced through the darkness of the dimly lit offices. He was 
making good pursuit as far as he could tell and could just about make 
out Linda in the distance. She proceeded to lead him in circles around 
the department. Rory was about to catch her when he tripped over a 
bin he was unable to spot in the dark. She stopped running and came 
over to him. 
"You alright?"
"Yeah. Stupid bin."
She chuckled and went to turn on the light.
"Looks like I win." she said and looked down at her hand but it was 
empty. 
Rory held up the key. He'd snatched it off her just before she went to 
turn on the light. In the darkness she didn't notice.
"I don't think so." he announced triumphantly.
"You know, in different circumstances you would make a good 
pickpocket."
As she walked over to help him up she felt the tiredness weigh down on 
her. She stopped.
"You okay?"
"I think the caffeine is wearing off."
"Let's go home then." 
***
	The next morning was the day of the interrogation. Linda didn't 
know how Rory had found out that the girl was conscious, but she didn't 
particularly care. This had to be done as soon as possible. Her grip 
tightened on the driving wheel in anticipation.
	Aileen's grip was also tight on her daughter's hand as they 
arrived at the hospital. Jo quite frankly just wanted to get the whole 
thing done and over with, hoping that maybe Cally would've come to 
her senses by now and wouldn't be blaming her for such a horrific 
crime. Her mother was trying her best not to lash out at anyone, 
preparing herself mentally for the interrogation. She knew that she was 
angered easily but didn't want to do anything stupid during the 
interview. They joined the queue stretching out from reception and 
waited. After a good five minutes or so they finally got to the front and 
were able to talk to the receptionist. 
"Hello how can I help you?" the woman asked.
"We're here to see Cally Sanders."
"How are you related to the patient?"
"I'm her mother." replied Aileen.
"I'm her sister." said Jo.
"Okay, she's on floor 3 in the Dresden ward. You're not her first 
visitors."
"The police must have already got here." sighed Aileen.
"Police?" said the receptionist in surprise. "No, she had a visitor 
yesterday. He wasn't family so I didn't tell him where she was but he 
found her all the same. He claimed to be her boyfriend, but didn't even 
know what her medical problem was."
"Dolph." said Jo and her mother in unison.
"I hope he didn't cause too much of a commotion." Jo said half-
heartedly.
"He ran down a ward which has to be kept silent at all times." said the 
receptionist raising an eyebrow. Jo was not terribly surprised. It was 
safe to say that Dolph was good at causing trouble. "Doctor Rogers 
discovered him kissing the patient. When he asked what the boy was 
doing there he ran off."
"That sounds like him." Jo murmured to herself.
"Come on Jo, let's go see Cally."
She thanked the receptionist and they set off.
       Aileen was still holding her daughter's hand. Her clasp however 
had tightened considerably as they made their way up the stairs.
"Mum you're going to break my hand at this rate."
"Sorry." But her grip did not lessen, if anything it grew stronger. Jo could 
tell that she was seething. "I'm going to have a word with that boy if it's 
the last thing I do!" 
"Let's focus on the interrogation first." Jo reminded.
She took her mother's silence for agreement and they continued to go 
up the stairs. Eventually they arrived at the right floor. It took them 
nowhere near as long as Dolph had to find the right ward.
	On seeing her sister Jo ran over to the bed she was laying in but 
to her surprise Cally simply glared at her. When Jo reached out to take 
her hand she shied away. From the look on her face Jo could tell that 
Cally seemed to be repulsed by the idea of being touched by her own 
sister.
"Cally?" she said in confusion.
However then her mother came to Jo's side and Cally's reaction to her 
was a complete opposite to how she'd been towards her sister. She 
pulled her mother in for a hug much to Jo's surprise. Cally was not a 
hugging kind of person as far as she was aware. Aileen was also startled 
but happy to embrace her daughter.
"Thank god you are alright!" 
"The doctor said I could come home today."
"I thought they said they had to do tests?" Jo pointed out.
"They didn't take as long as the doctor thought they would." Cally 
replied with an unusually smug tone to her voice.
Aileen smiled at this, but then remembered the news she'd been fuming 
about on the way up.
"We heard about Dolph's visit yesterday."
"More like a break in." Jo muttered.
At the mention of this Cally beamed.
"Yes, isn't it sweet of him?"
Aileen seemed mildly shocked by this point of view, and re-thought her 
anger to find herself agreeing with Cally. In a way, it was rather 
romantic. Jo, who knew his real motives, wasn't impressed.
"Did he even bring you anything?" asked Jo.
Cally glared at her.
"He'd only just found out I was in hospital."
"I'll take that as a no."
"Well I don't see you bringing me anything!" Cally snapped. 
Jo was hurt by her sister's accusation and reached into the bag she'd 
brought with her to the hospital. She pulled out a card she'd made 
herself and a box of chocolates before placing them on the bedside.
"Home has been -" Jo paused trying to think of a word to describe it. "- 
weird, without you."
Cally picked up the card and examined the front of it, squinting at Jo's 
bad attempt at drawing.
"What's that supposed to be?"
"You, all better."
"Congratulations, you've managed to make me look like a giraffe." Next 
Cally turned her head to look at the chocolates. "And within a few days' 
time I'm going to be a really fat giraffe."
"Now Cally, it's the thought that counts." said her mother.
Cally didn't look convinced. Jo looked down, trying to avoid her sister's 
eyes. 
"So did the doctors work out why you collapsed in the first place?" 
Aileen said eager to change the subject.
"Something about exhaustion, but my symptoms were weird so they're 
not entirely sure about anything at the moment. That's why they had to 
do the tests, but they didn't really confirm anything."
Cally's eyes widened as she caught sight of policemen walking into the 
ward.
"What are they doing here?"
"I don't like it either darling but they have to interrogate you."
"What?! NO. I'm not answering any of their questions." Cally protested.
"You've got nothing to hide, so what is the big deal?" said Jo.
Cally shot daggers at her sister when she made this remark. 
"I don't exactly want to re-live the experience."
Jo was unsympathetic. She already had.
"Tough."
Before Cally could retort the policewoman was by her side, 
accompanied by the man who had been on 'babysitting duty' with Jo 
yesterday at the car park.
"Is it okay if we ask a few questions?" said the policewoman.
"No. Bog off!" Cally exclaimed.
The lady's expression hardened into a frown.
"Let me rephrase that, we need to ask you a few questions."
"Go ahead. I'm not going to give you any answers." said Cally 
stubbornly.
"Cally please." said Aileen.
Her daughter sighed in irritation.
"Fine. Make it quick."
The policewoman nodded to the man beside her.
"Why were you in the car park at the time of the incident?" he asked.
"I was following Di."
"Why were you following her?"
"Because she told me to."
Rory and Linda exchanged glances. The policewoman jotted this new 
information down on her notepad that had seemed to have suddenly 
appeared out of nowhere.
"Okay, did she say anything to you before -" Rory began.
"Yes and no."
"Care to expand on that?"
Cally didn't look like she wanted to but did all the same.
"She started talking to me, saying how she wanted to come somewhere 
quiet to tell me about things, her last words were: it was Jo." Everybody 
stared at Jo. She felt herself shrink a little at the looks she was 
attracting. "And then -" Cally trailed off.
"I know it's going to be painful to remember but how did Diane end up 
like that?" Rory asked hesitantly.
"What, dead you mean?"
Jo shivered. At least her sister wasn't afraid to say the word.
"Yes."
"You wouldn't believe me if I told you."
"Try me."
"She started screaming. It was like something was sticking its hand 
inside her and pulling at her organs. Then her neck snapped, her side 
seemed to rip open and she collapsed. She writhed for a few minutes 
then stopped moving."
Cally was right, Rory did find it difficult to believe. However the look in 
the girl's eyes told a different story, she seemed to genuinely believe all 
of this. He looked to the policewoman for back up, she had countless 
experience. Surely she'd know whether Cally was telling the truth. She 
gave him a slight nod. He sneaked a glance at her notepad.
Story backs up forensics. 
Check CCTV cameras.
That was a good idea. He wondered why he hadn't thought of it before. 
He wrenched his mind away from the more practical side of the 
investigation and went back to his questioning.
"Where were you before the incident?"
"What do you mean?"
"You said Diane wanted to come somewhere quiet to talk to you, which 
implies you were somewhere loud beforehand. So where were you?"
Linda smiled. She hadn't picked up on that detail. Cally and Jo 
exchanged panicked glances.
"I - I was at a friend's house." Cally stuttered.
Jo relaxed slightly, that was true. In a way. Rory didn't miss her 
hesitation however or the worried looks. He sensed that he was onto 
something the girls wanted to keep quiet.
"What were you doing at the friend's house?"
"Girl stuff."
Rory frowned. She was definitely hiding something.
"Girl stuff?"
"Chatting about boyfriends, life, makeup, things you wouldn't 
understand."
"Then tell me about it." cut in Linda.
After all, the policewoman was a girl. Cally hadn't been expecting this 
and looked frantically at Jo for back up.
"I was there too." Jo added. "A lot of people were there."
Cally stared at Jo in shock.
"Why were you there?" asked Rory.
"For the same reason everyone else was, we wanted to relax at the 
weekend with a little party."
"A party about girl stuff?" he said sceptically.
"Yes! It was a slumber party!" exclaimed Cally but she was gripping onto 
loose straws at this point.
"You girls didn't tell me anything about a sleepover!" said Aileen 
suspiciously.
"What are you not telling us?" questioned Linda.
Jo turned to Cally. Enough was enough; there was only so much lying 
she would allow.
"We have to tell them."
"No."
"They're going to find out one way or another."
"NO." Cally said more insistently.
"If you won't tell them I will." Jo turned to face the police again. "We 
have parties at the weekend, Cally organises them, picks a friend to host 
it and tells me to invite my mates over. This week it was at Diane's 
house. Dolph was there and everything-"
"Whoa back up there, who's Dolph?"
"My boyfriend. He came to see me yesterday." Cally explained. 
The dreamy look on her face made Jo want to throw up.
"Anyways," Jo continued. "When Cally left I was surprised, she hadn't 
drank anything-"
"Drank anything?"
"Not one drop of alcohol, that was seriously unlike her."
"WHAT!?" Aileen said, almost yelling across the ward. 
At her yell the Doctor came rushing over asking her to keep her voice 
down. She agreed reluctantly. Jo couldn't bear to look at her mother. 
She could feel the betrayed eyes boring into her.
"Wait, where did you get the alcohol from?" interrogated Rory.
"Shops, like everyone else." said Cally scathingly.
He did not look impressed by her attitude. Jo filled in the extra details 
for him.
"Cally's friends have older siblings, it's easy enough for them to get their 
hands on it and bring it along."
"Okay, one last question and we're done. Can you give me the full name 
of your boyfriend please?" 
"So you can go harass him? I don't think so!" Cally exclaimed.
"Dolph Andrews." Jo said, happy to annoy her sister's boyfriend further.
"Thank you."
With that the police left leaving an awkward silence between the three 
family members. Jo was so glad that they would be spending this week 
with their father instead of their mother. He had a different way of 
showing anger. Then again, that meant their mother's anger towards 
them had a week's time to build up. 
	Aileen was disturbingly silent as the Doctor came over for a 
second time to inform her of her daughter's mysterious condition and 
remained dangerously quiet as the family left the hospital. Eventually 
they arrived home. However as soon as the front door to the house was 
closed she exploded. 
"HOW DARE YOU!" she screamed.
"Mum I can explain -" Jo began.
"DON'T EVEN TRY! YOU WENT ALONG WITH IT ALL! I THOUGHT I COULD 
TRUST YOU TWO! APPARENTLY NOT. HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING 
ON FOR? A FEW WEEKS? A FEW MONTHS? A FEW YEARS?!"
"Ever since you and dad split up." Jo whispered.
"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!" 
"I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY!" Cally yelled back sarcastically at her mother, 
her blaring voice matching the strength of Aileen's. 
"HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON BEHIND MY BACK FOR?"
"LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO BE AS GOOD AS BLIND! YOU'RE A 
RUBBISH MUM AND YOU KNOW IT! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO 
WITHOUT DOLPH BECAUSE HE'S THE CLOSEST I CAN GET TO REAL 
COMFORT AROUND HERE!" Cally ranted.
Aileen looked as if Cally had just punched her. She was not the only one; 
Jo was hurt too by this announcement.
"What about me?" Jo said, her voice was barely audible but Cally's ears 
picked up her tiny complaint all the same.
She turned on her sister.
"WHAT ABOUT YOU!? YOU ARE ALWAYS DISSING MY BOYFRIEND, YOU 
TREAT ME LIKE I CAN'T LOOK AFTER MYSELF, YOU GIVE ME CRAPPY 
PRESENTS AND YOU CAN'T EVEN STAND UP FOR YOURSELF! OH AND I 
FORGOT; YOU KILLED MY BEST FRIEND!!!"  Cally bellowed.
"She was my friend too." Jo said her voice a little louder this time.
"OH LOOK AT THAT, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE FOR 
HER TO ACTUALLY SPEAK LOUDER THAN AN ANT. I'M IMPRESSED."
"I didn't kill her." Jo said, firmly this time. 
"DON'T YOU DENY IT SHE TOLD ME HERSELF!" Cally roared.
Jo could tell that Cally was close to throwing things. She took a step 
back before her sister could do anything rash. But Jo was a little too 
slow in moving and Aileen was too busy absorbing Cally's insult to react 
in time. Cally picked up her mother's heels from the shoe rack beside 
her and threw them at Jo. The shoes hit her hard in the face and she fell 
over backwards. The force of the throw was far beyond Cally's normal 
strength. It looked like anger gave her that much more of an advantage.
"Joanne!" her mother gasped. Jo pushed the heavy heels off her face 
and got to her feet. Aileen was relieved that her daughter was standing. 
She turned to Cally. "GO TO YOUR ROOM!"
"I'm not staying here." announced Jo whilst her mother was occupied 
with the task of yelling at her sister. She took this opportunity to walk 
out of the door whilst Cally went in the opposite direction. 
       As soon as she got outside Jo started to run. It would be a while 
before her mother noticed she was gone, her sister was a big handful 
when she was angry. Gradually Jo slowed to a gentle walk as she 
explored London. She knew exactly where she was going although the 
pain in her head made it difficult to concentrate. When the throbbing 
streaked through her the streets went temporarily blurry. This made it 
considerably difficult to read signs but Jo knew the route like the back of 
her hand. The noise and bustle of the London streets made her feel 
claustrophobic and lightheaded, plus she didn't like the concerned looks 
people gave her as she walked by. Jo decided to take the path through 
the park. It almost felt like she was drunk. She had to focus carefully on 
putting one foot in front of the other but still managed to sway as she 
went. She walked (well, wobbled is more of an accurate word) past a 
happy family having a picnic. A little kid was running around the group 
playing with a friend. As she walked the child accidentally bumped into 
her.
"Sorry." the kid apologised but then scrutinised her face a little more 
closely. "Are you okay? You've got a big purple thing on your face."
At this news Jo felt a little more worried and sped up. It wasn't long 
until she made it out of the park. By now her mobile phone was ringing. 
She knew it would be her mum but she wasn't going to answer to her 
just yet. She stumbled along the streets until she turned a corner and 
finally arrived at her destination. Jo walked up through the front garden 
and rang the doorbell. The door opened to reveal a tall man. Dark, 
untidy hair reminiscent of Harry Potter's spiked up from his head which 
was quite a contrast compared to his posh, black business suit.
"Hello dad." she greeted.
"Jo what are you doing here? I'm meant to pick you and your sister up 
after dinner."
She swayed a little on the spot much to her father's alarm.
"Cally got angry. Just let me in and I'll explain everything."
His eyes widened as he too noticed the huge purpling bruise that 
stretched across Jo's face.
"Oh my god what happened to your head?"
"Cally threw mum's heels at me. I couldn't stay there. Please just let me 
in dad." 
"She what!? Come in." Jo's father led the way inside. "Let's get 
something cold on that head of yours." Jo slumped onto the living room 
couch as her father went into the kitchen. He soon came back with a 
cold compress and laid it on the side of her face. Jo winced but said 
nothing. For a few minutes they just sat there in silence. She liked her 
father for this reason; he was willing to wait for her to be ready to tell 
him what he needed to know, unlike Aileen who wanted to understand 
things instantly. "I've told your mother time and time again that Cally 
she should see a counsellor so she can deal with these anger issues. But 
will she listen to me? No."
        Jo didn't like it when he brought up Aileen. In fact, she didn't 
like it when either of her parents talked about each other. The pair 
seemed to have difficulty saying anything nice when it concerned the 
other person. They'd split up barely a month ago yet it was hard to 
believe they had ever been a married couple happily in love. Jo sighed. 
She wished things had stayed the way they were, but she knew for a 
fact that life just didn't work that way.
"I suppose I should probably tell you what happened this weekend. It's 
-" Jo paused, trying to think of words to describe it. "- a long story to 
say the least."
***
Back at the scene of the crime Rory was analysing CCTV footage of the 
car park as instructed. Since the place was connected to a shopping 
centre there were cameras present at several different angles. The third 
floor of the car park had been sealed off naturally, after the murder a 
full police investigation was launched. Linda was head of the operation 
of course and saw that everything went as smoothly as it could. This 
was considerably difficult and had her in a bad mood for most of the 
day. Rory admired her skills from a distance. The curious thing about the 
level of the car park was that the camera which looked directly down on 
the murder stopped working when the girl started to scream. The 
footage showed Cally following Diane into the car park and they talked 
briefly, however then fuzzy static enveloped the screen before the 
camera returned to normal to show the girl's mangled body. He then 
watched the end of the footage to see Jo come in, Cally collapse and Jo 
escape with her sister to the lift. However none of the other CCTV 
cameras had been able to spot the approaching person Jo claimed that 
she ran from.
"Any luck?"
Rory jumped and span round. 
"Oh it's just you." Linda laughed and he sheepishly began to answer the 
question. "Not really, the camera fuzzes out just when we need it most. 
You can see Cally and Diane talking beforehand and Jo and Cally's 
escape afterwards but nothing else of use."
"Strange. I wonder what could've caused that."
"I was hoping you'd know."
"Well, we should try to work out what Cally and Diane are saying to 
each other before she dies, that will at least give us some insight into 
whether Cally was telling the truth this morning."
"How do we do that? This thing has got no sound as far as I'm aware."
Linda chewed her lip. Rory knew that look, she had an idea.
"Know any lip readers?"
***
As Jo finished explaining to her father he stood up and went over to the 
phone.
"Dad what are you doing?" 
"Calling your mother."
"What!? No! Please don't!"
"She needs to know that you are safe."
"Oh." Jo let out a sigh of relief. She thought that he was going to call her 
and just have a go at her. They argued enough as it was, she didn't want 
to hear any more of that. Then again, it was far more likely that her 
mother would have a go at him. Personally she thought her father had 
much more reason to do so when Aileen hadn't even told him about 
Cally being hospitalized.
       He picked up the phone and started to dial the numbers. Just as 
he was about to leave the room Jo sat up. 
"Dad?"
"Yes?"
"Can you ask her if I can stay over here? It'll be just one extra 
afternoon."
"Jo you know how she is about these things -"
"Please?" she begged.
Jo had a go at her best puppy dog eyes attempt. Her father laughed at 
the bizarre resulting expression, but whatever she'd done seemed to 
work.
"I'll try."
He walked into the hallway that lead out from the house entrance and 
started talking into the phone. Jo strained her ears to hear the 
conversation but quiet chat slowly turned into shouting and she no 
longer tried. She hated this. But it was always the way things turned 
out. If anything it was making her head feel worse. 
       Finally the conversation (if you could even call it that) came to 
an end. Her father walked back into the room looking rather drained of 
energy.
"What did she say?"
"You didn't hear it?"
"Yelling through a phone is not the same thing as yelling here and now."
"Oh right." he said sheepishly. Clearly Jo's father had forgotten that she 
only heard one half of the conversation. "She said you could stay here 
for the night. But as you could probably tell she wasn't very happy 
about it."
Jo was relieved. There was no way she could go back to face Cally. Her 
sister had been right about one thing; she couldn't stand up for herself. 
She relaxed onto the sofa and reached for the TV remote. 
"Okay." she sighed.
"You just rest, have you had any lunch yet?"
"Nope."
"Right." Jo grimaced at the thought of her father cooking. He had even 
managed to make the microwave explode once. He noticed her 
expression. "Don't panic, I'll order some pizza." he assured her before 
turning to the kitchen.
       Jo switched on the TV but it was difficult to focus on any of the 
programs for too long, partly because the screen appeared to be 
blurred and secondly because she simply couldn't keep her eyes open. 
After ten minutes of this her father nipped back round the corner 
holding a cup in his hand.
"Tea?"
She smiled. It was the one thing her father could make in the kitchen 
without encountering disaster, which was just as well considering that 
John Sanders was a tea addict.
"Thanks."
He passed her the cup along with a small plate he'd been holding by his 
side. 
"I've phoned the pizza delivery guys, they should be round in fifteen 
minutes or so." John sat down beside his daughter. "You look tired."
"I feel tired." Jo acknowledged.
"Maybe it's those parties you told me about." he said, his voice taking 
on a disapproving tone. 
"Dad, I told you, the past few weeks I've been trying to get out of them. 
Besides I was distracted by Cally before I had the opportunity to get 
drunk this time round."
"Darling your mother has probably already told you this," he paused 
before continuing, being careful with his word choice. "- rather 
forcefully, but neither of us want you destroying your liver at your age."
"Dad if I was destroying my liver I think I'd realise."
"Life isn't that simple."
Her father's gentle lecturing affected Jo more than her mother's yells 
had. He seemed sad and disappointed with her. 
"I'm sorry. I won't do it again." she apologised in a small voice.
"That's my girl." The doorbell rang. "And that's probably the delivery 
men."
The tension that had built up between the pair shattered as John 
jumped to his feet and rushed back into the hall. A few minutes later he 
returned with the box. 
"That smells good."
Together they sat on the sofa, watching the end of a Simpsons episode, 
snacking on Margherita pizza. Jo supressed a laugh at the guzzling 
sounds her father made when he ate. From the excessively pig-like 
noises he was making she guessed he was trying to make her smile at 
least. She laid her head on his shoulder and was on the verge of falling 
asleep when he spoke.
"You know I got the bed all warmed up for you upstairs before calling 
the delivery men, do you want a nap?"
Jo was touched. She wasn't entirely sure why though: it was her father's 
job to look after her. 
"Dad, don't fuss. It's just after midday. If I go to sleep now it'll be 
impossible to get to sleep at bedtime. Plus my body clock will get all 
messed up."
"Come on, you know you want to!"
Jo raised an eyebrow.
"You know how they always lecture us about peer pressure at school 
dad."
John rolled his eyes.
"Fine. But in that case you have to do something active before dinner."
"Okay."
Jo grinned, she could compromise. But for the moment, she was quite 
happy resting her face in front of the TV. She was beginning to feel 
better all ready. That sick dizzy feeling she'd had earlier was virtually 
gone. Maybe she'd just been hungry?
"I've got to have a conference call soon darling so try not to interrupt 
me unless it's urgent." John informed her before leaving the room.
Jo watched the television and started to pay attention to what was 
actually going on in the news. 
"Only yesterday a mangled body was found in London's main car park. 
Police are not commenting on the matter at this time but the CCTV 
footage from the area allegedly shows two young girls escaping from 
the aftermath. Now we go to Charlotte on the scene." said the calm 
newsreader.
       Jo sat up instantly on hearing this. The news cut to a reporter at 
the car park entrance. She was part of the paparazzi crowd trying to 
interview the policewoman Jo had met again only this morning. The lady 
seemed to be trying to say as little as possible.
"Thanks Mike. Here I am with Linda Porter, head of the police 
department and this investigation." The woman with the microphone 
turned to face Linda. "What can you tell us about the two girls seen 
escaping on the CCTV?"
Linda frowned. How did the reporter know about the CCTV footage? 
She sighed. Did things really get out that quickly?
"I can tell you that they're none of your business. I'm sorry but this 
investigation is off limits to the press."
Linda had decided a long time ago that no newspaper should be allowed 
to get their hands on crimes like these. Call her paranoid but she didn't 
like the rumours the stories sparked. The reporter ignored this and 
continued to probe the irritated policewoman.
"Do you know how the victim: thirteen year old Diane Vickers died?"
"Firstly her name is Diane Metters and she's fifteen, secondly as I said 
this investigation is off limits to press." Linda replied angrily pushing 
away the microphone that the reporter kept jabbing in her direction.
The reporter however only seemed encouraged by the policewoman's 
response and continued to follow her to the car park entrance to ask 
more questions.  Then the policeman who'd interviewed Cally that 
morning stopped the reporter.
"Sorry lady, you can't come in here. This area is closed off."
The story went back to the newsreader in the studio.
"We are lucky enough to have a recording of the CCTV footage everyone 
is so concerned about-"
Jo turned off the TV in shock. Everyone watching the news was going to 
see her escape with Cally. Tomorrow was a Monday. A school day. How 
would they ever be able to escape the rumours? 
       Her body drooped in dismay and she held her head in her 
hands. Unfortunately Jo had forgotten about the huge bruise across her 
face.
"Ow." she muttered and proceeded to remove her hands.
She had to find some way to cover up this bruise by tomorrow. 















Chapter 3
Linda was not happy. But then again, that went without saying. Rory 
had just finished and left the reporters to his fellow policemen. 
Hopefully they'd deal with the nosy interviewers. He chased after her, 
sensing that she needed someone to talk to.
"That stupid woman hadn't even got her facts right!" she fumed. Rory 
slowed down a little. Maybe she just needed someone to yell at. 
Perhaps this wasn't such a good idea. He contemplated what he should 
say for several minutes but took a little too long. "Well? What is it?"
"Erm - nothing. Sorry to bother you." 
Rory hurried away as fast he could. Linda glared after him. 
	He joined his fellow cops at the car park entrance. It looked like 
they had managed to fend off the majority of the crowd. Most of the 
reporters were leaving with sulky looks on their faces but a few stayed, 
staring at the police from a distance. It seemed like they just needed to 
watch the perimeter for the moment. His friend Mark smirked at Rory's 
return.
"What did I tell you? She's not in the mood to have a civil conversation."
Rory rolled his eyes.
"All in good time."
The policemen under her charge admired Linda grudgingly but were 
always ready to have a good bitch about her the minute her back was 
turned. Initially Rory had joined in quite happily, knowing it was part of 
the job but since last night with the caffeine high he couldn't quite bring 
himself to insult her. Now he knew that the strict exterior was only one 
part of her. For just a few minutes he'd managed to catch Linda when 
she was relaxed, cheerful and - vulnerable. He would've told Mark. But 
Mark would've got the wrong idea; he tended to do that a lot. Besides, 
his friend probably wouldn't believe him in the first place. He could 
understand that. After all, even he hadn't believed it until yesterday 
night.
       "You've been talking to her a lot lately." Mark commented.
"What about it?"
"Nothing, just saying."
"You know this is the kind of case I'm interested in." Rory said, in an 
attempt to steer his friend from the conclusion he thought he was 
coming to.
"Yeah right. Grisly murder? When I first saw you looking at the photos 
of that body you looked ready to faint. This case isn't your thing." Mark 
remembered mockingly. "So it's something to do with Porter."
"No it isn't."
"Yes it is. Why so defensive?" Mark teased.
"Just leave it."
"Ah I'm onto something then!"
Rory groaned. Sometimes he didn't know why he was friends with Mark 
when he could be so annoying.
"She's been getting me to do a lot of work on this case and to be honest 
I owe her." Rory retorted. "You remember that time with the five year 
old-"
Mark winced at the memory.
"Only too well mate. Don't go there."
"She bailed me out then, so I owe her. The worst part is she knows it 
too."
"If you say so." said Mark, he didn't sound very convinced though.
Rory looked at his friend and braced himself.
"Say it." Rory commanded.
"Say what?" asked Mark trying to act like he didn't know what Rory was 
talking about.
Rory was not fooled.
"Say what's on your mind."
"Why should I? I get the impression you don't want to know."
"I know you." Rory sighed. "If you don't say it you're going to yell it out 
at an inappropriate moment. Let's just get it done and over with."
 "You fancy Porter."
Rory sighed, relieved that Mark wasn't going to shout that out at an 
inappropriate moment. Then he continued to deny it. 
"You sound like you're still in high school. No I don't."
"Then why do you keep talking to her?"
"Is it really so wrong to have a friendly relationship with your boss?"
"No, but this is Porter we're talking about."
"Did someone say my name?" asked the policewoman as she stepped 
out from the car park entrance.
Mark shook his head.
"No ma'am."
Rory supressed a chuckle; Mark was afraid of Linda if anything.
"Rory come with me. I just got us our lip-reader." she commanded.
Mark gave Rory a look but Rory ignored him and followed her as she 
lead the way back up to the room which contained the CCTV footage.
"How did you find the lip-reader exactly?" he asked.
"It took a lot of phoning round." she dead-panned.
He decided not to probe any further, Linda still looked angry about that 
interviewer and he had a nasty feeling she'd explode in his face if he 
stated any more questions.
	Eventually they arrived at the room. A young woman was sitting 
inside. She looked slightly nervous. 
"Thank you for coming. We just need you to tell us what the two girls 
are saying at the start of the tape." Linda explained.
The woman nodded and Rory rewound the video. Together the group 
watched. Rory was full of anticipation but Linda just wanted to get it 
done and over with. She was in a bad enough mood already without this 
woman taking ages to do her job. The screen started to fuzz over with 
static and Rory paused the video. For a few moments there was silence; 
then the lip-reader spoke. 
"At the start the girl who isn't dead-"
"Call her Cally for the purpose of this exercise." Rory cut in to prevent 
further confusion.
"Okay, at the start of the video Cally says to her dead meat friend: 
what's going on?"
"Just call her the victim."
"The dead meat friend or the other girl?"
"The dead meat friend."
The lip-reader blushed slightly but continued.
"The victim replies: Cally I'm scared; I just wanted to talk to you 
somewhere where we could be alone and where it's quiet. Cally says: 
did you really have to drag me out here just for a chat? The victim says: 
yes, it's about Dolph. Cally asks her what her problem is, saying that 
everyone is picking on him. The victim says that Dolph is not good for 
her, that he's been doing some horrible things that she doesn't know 
about. That nobody knows about apart from her. Cally gets suspicious 
and asks her what. The victim tells her that it was Jo who warned Cally 
about him and that Cally should have listened. She says that it was Jo 
who - but then the static cuts in."
Rory and Linda exchanged glances. 
"Thank you. That was most....revealing." said Linda.
"Can I go now?"
"Of course."
The woman promptly got up and left the room.
"So Cally's story was accurate, from a certain point of view." Rory 
remarked. "Technically she didn't even lie."
"But she withheld information from us. That's just as bad." Linda added.
"I think we should meet this Dolph."
"I think you're right." Linda agreed. "But we can do that tomorrow; you 
have one huge report to fill out."
She smiled at his groan.
***
On Monday Jo's father drove her to school and she was glad for the 
transport. By now everyone she knew would've seen the video of the 
CCTV footage on the news. The last thing Jo wanted was to feel the 
stares as she walked down the streets of London. The car acted as a 
shield. She'd rather face bad traffic than the whispers. Cally however 
wasn't as lucky.
	Aileen had given her a lecture on laying low for a few days. The 
pair had seen the news and her mother insisted that Cally should make 
an actual effort not to get into trouble. Maybe then people would forget 
about her more easily but Cally strode down the street as per normal, 
refusing to hide or duck her head as her sister would've done. In fact, 
she held her head high. She was proud of who she was. The people had 
it wrong. Jo had killed Diane, not her. The stares weren't so bad on the 
street, they were just from strangers and Cally could kid herself that 
they were insane anyways. She didn't mind the attention. But when she 
arrived at school the attention suddenly seemed unwanted and the 
stares became irksome. She tried to ignore them but it was difficult 
work that distracted her easily. The first lesson she had that day was 
science. She marched off to the room and queued outside with 
everyone else. She could hear people exchanging gossip and small talk 
but all their chattering gradually faded to silence as she joined the line. 
Cally was a lot more effective at quieting the class than her science 
teacher would ever be. Nobody was sure what to say to her. Eventually 
Kaela, one of her friends, tried to strike up a conversation.
"How are you?"
"I'm alright. You?"
Cally knew what she was saying was a severe understatement but 
couldn't care less. She wasn't going to give the queue the satisfaction of 
hearing how she really felt.
"Yeah I'm good."
Cally glimpsed someone in the queue doing the awkward turtle sign as 
the silence returned (don't ask. It's just a phase the pupils went 
through).
"Did you do anything interesting at the weekend?" Kaela asked 
hesitantly.
"You were there for the party, you should know." Cally replied. 
"Oh yeah, that was fun."
"Glad someone enjoyed it." sighed Cally.
The teacher arrived at this point and let the class into the room. They 
sat down in the seating plan and got out their science exercise books. 
Almost as soon as the teacher started talking Cally was in daydream 
mode. She was homing in on what people were talking about behind 
her. The entire row seemed to be having a whispered debate. Well, it 
was more of a whispered speculation than anything else.
"Do you think she did it?" hissed Katie.
"Cally would never do that. She's my friend." replied Kaela defiantly.
Cally smiled warmly, it was nice to know that someone was going to 
defend her other than her boyfriend.
"You sure about that? That's what Diane thought."
"Am I the only person here considering the fact that Jo could've done 
it?" said Josh who sat next to Kaela.
Cally found herself agreeing with him.
"She's too much of a goody two shoes. Asides from attending parties; 
she simply isn't bad enough to do something like that." cut in another 
boy.
"But she's quiet. You never know what goes on in a quiet person's 
head." Josh argued.
"Don't be stupid. Ben's right, whatever she thinks Jo just hasn't got it in 
her to murder someone. As for Cally -"
"Why are we even considering this? Just because they were there 
doesn't mean they did it!" Kaela exclaimed a little too loudly. 
"Kaela, do you have something to contribute to the lesson?" asked Mrs 
Richardson.
"No Miss."
"Then don't talk over me."
"Sorry Miss."
For a few minutes there was silence. But then a different voice spoke 
up. This one belonged to one of the popular kids. Her name was Jasmine 
and as far as Cally was concerned the girl was evil. 
"No doubt about it, Cally's the reason why Di is dead. You know how 
easily she loses her temper. Besides, just listen to the name: Di - she 
had it coming."
Cally's head whipped round at this comment. She felt herself launch out 
of her seat. It was more of a reflex than anything else. She found herself 
towering over Jasmine. So much for laying low.
"HOW DARE YOU!" she yelled and raised a fist but then her science 
teacher interrupted her.
"Cally!" screamed Mrs Richardson. "Sit down NOW." Cally eyed the 
teacher defiantly. "I said SIT. Don't make me treat you like a dog." There 
was some sniggering at this comment. Cally narrowed her eyes, was Mrs 
Richardson calling her a bitch? All the same she sat down. "Jasmine 
what did you say to her?"
"Nothing! I was just minding my own business! She overreacted to 
nothing."
"That's not true -"cut in Kaela.
"That's the second time you have interrupted me today Kaela, one more 
time and it's a detention. I was not asking you." Kaela was silent. The 
teacher turned to face Cally. "Detention. Be thankful it's not more. If I 
ever catch you treating a student like that again it will be a suspension." 
Cally felt her hatred steadily growing. As the teacher continued to 
explain the exercise they were meant to be working on Cally felt her 
anger focus into one hot white point that converged on the teacher. 
Mrs Richardson stood at the front of the classroom complete unaware 
of the death glare. "Has anyone seen where my stapler went?"
The class said nothing. Mrs Richardson looked irritated.
"Oh. It's here Miss!" called Ben waving the stapler in the air.
"Watch where you're waving that!" exclaimed Josh.
Mrs Richardson quickly swiped the stapler from Ben's hand and went 
back to the front of the classroom. 
"You get on with your work, I need to staple this poster up." she 
informed the class and turned her back to them.
	At first everything seemed normal but then Mrs Richardson 
heard a rather bizarre high pitched giggle coming from behind her. 
"Can whoever is making that noise stop? You're too old to sound like 
you belong in a nursery school." she snapped. The person laughing 
ignored her. The laughter was slowly turning into an ear splitting 
screech as the pitch rose higher. It seemed more like the kid belonged in 
an asylum. But the teacher had a feeling she'd get into trouble if she 
voiced her true thoughts. Mrs Richardson sighed and whipped round to 
face the students. The laughter stopped abruptly as she shouted at the 
class. "I told you to be quiet!"
This was not the first time she had caught the kids laughing behind her 
back. Last time it had been because that gormless idiot Dolph had stuck 
something on her. Fortunately the technician had pointed it out before 
she could walk down any corridors and embarrass herself fully. Mrs 
Richardson narrowed her eyes and groped around her back. Nothing 
was there. The kids stared at her innocently. They certainly weren't this 
good at acting normally. They looked confused.
"I think Miss has finally lost it!" Katie whispered.
Her friend nodded in agreement.
Mrs Richardson blinked. She was hearing things. That couldn't be good. 
She shook her head and turned around but the laughter was back, this 
time it was not alone. A cacophony of creepy childish shrieks made her 
turn around. Now she was scared. She seemed to be the only person in 
the room who could hear the disturbing noises. All the same, there was 
no harm in checking.
"Kaela can you hear that?"
"Hear what?"
"I'll take that as a no. What about you Josh?"
Josh looked equally perplexed.
"Erm...is this a trick question?"
Mrs Richardson backed away from the students and put her hands over 
her ears. The noise was so loud it was almost painful.
"Leave me alone!" she whispered in panic.
All of a sudden the teacher felt a warm liquid on her forehead. She 
touched it with the tip of her finger and was shocked to discover a dark 
red substance on her skin. She backed away further and bumped into 
the whiteboard. That was when the projector crashed down just in front 
of her. It made a crunching noise as it impacted onto the classroom 
floor making several pupils jump and a few girls squeal in surprise. Then 
the screams of terror came as they examined the projector a little more 
closely. It was oozing a horrible oily substance like the one that had 
dripped onto the teacher's forehead. On the bright side, the childish 
laughter had stopped abruptly as the projector hit the floor. The 
students started to talk anxiously amongst themselves as Mrs 
Richardson stood at the front of the class frozen in shock. The disgusting 
liquid was leaking from the machine itself and was making an icky mess 
on the floor. The liquid seemed to gravitate towards the teacher as it 
spread and this reality helped to bring her to her senses. Nervously she 
leapt over the substance and went towards the door.
"Children get into a line outside the classroom. I'm going to get the 
technician."
But as Mrs Richardson started to walk away she heard the mysterious 
laughter again. She refrained from placing her hands over her ears and 
bit her lip instead. She was shaking.
	The news was all over school that lunchtime. Mrs Richardson 
had completely freaked out, with good reason for a change. Rumour 
had it she was still in the nurse's office being given treatment for shock 
after the antics of the previous lesson. Word quickly spread of the 
bleeding projector and the teacher's ability to hear voices. As per usual 
the story became even more warped through the passing on of the tale 
and by the time it got to Jo it made very little sense. Her friend Yasmine 
was telling it to her at the lunch table. 
       Yasmine was one of Jo's best friends. But Jo still refused to tell 
her anything in detail about the weekend. Don't get her wrong, Yasmine 
was a brilliant friend, but she couldn't avoid gossip no matter how hard 
she tried. Not that she had ever tried. 
"So basically Mrs Bitchardson went mental and attacked a student!" 
Yasmine finished, with that insane grin on her face that always came 
with her re-telling of a good story.
"Don't call her that." Jo sighed. 
"What, mental?"
"No I mean Mrs Bitchardson."
"Why not? The nickname suits her."
"Even if she doesn't hear you call her that I bet you some other teacher 
will. Plus it's not very nice."
"But it's true!"
Jo couldn't argue there. She'd never got into serious trouble with Mrs 
Richardson but she'd seen enough to know people who had. Quite 
frankly the woman terrified her.
"That doesn't make it right."
"Oh whatever. So what do you think?"
"It's certainly a sensational story." Jo commented. Yasmine's grin grew. 
She seemed to take this as a compliment rather than a remark about 
the tale's accuracy. "But where did Mrs Richardson manage to get a 
crowbar from?"
"How should I know? All I'm sure of is that she went crazy."
"Remind me how?"
"Were you even listening!?" Yasmine made a show of looking irritated 
but barely managed to hide her glee at the joy of repeating the details 
to Jo again. "She started yelling at the class to shut up when for once 
the group wasn't even talking! Which is impressive considering Katie is 
in that group-"
Jo sensed a tangent coming.
"Yas, focus."
"Oh yeah right, sorry." she continued. "Then she backed into the 
whiteboard covering her ears and shrieking before the room's projector 
fell down in front of her. Except it was oozing blood."
"I wonder what the technician said about that." cut in Ally who had also 
been listening to Yasmine's story.
"I don't know! Ask him!"
"I heard that she was yelling at someone for nearly punching Jasmine 
before she started hearing things." added Zoe, another member of Jo's 
friendship group who sat at the table beside her.
"Good for whoever that was. That popular is a bitch if I ever saw one!" 
Ettie piped up.
"Oh yeah, I think it was your sister, Jo." Ally mentioned.
By this point Yasmine's face had turned a powerful hue of red. She 
didn't like her gossip powers to be upstaged in the slightest. The others 
took the hint and stopped talking to allow Yasmine time to get back on 
top of the story.
"As I was saying - the projector was covered in blood and guts-"
Jo winced at the gory description her friend was producing as did the 
others. She decided to daydream until Yasmine's face returned to its 
regular colour. She rested her head on one hand and stared blankly into 
space. Although thanks to the bruise doing that hurt at little Jo didn't 
stop. Finally Yasmine appeared to have calmed down a little. She liked 
to be on top of things. Jo sat up a little straighter and removed her hand 
from her face. 
"Oh my god Jo what is that?" exclaimed Ally.
"What's what?"
"On your face!"
Her friends were all staring at her intently.
"What are you talking about?" 
"Jo you can't seriously tell us you haven't noticed the purple mark 
covering your cheek." said Ettie dubiously.
Jo glanced down at her hand. It was covered in foundation. Now half of 
her bruise was revealed to her friends.
"Oh that! It's nothing."
"That is not nothing. Look me in the eyes and tell me that's nothing." Jo 
didn't look up. "See! It's something." Yasmine concluded triumphantly.
"Look I don't want to talk about it right now."
"When will you talk about it?"
"When we're in a less public place. For now I need the loo." she lied. 
"Back in a mo."
"I'll come with you, I'm desperate!" said Ally.
Jo restrained a groan. Going to the loo was her means of escape; she 
needed to reapply her makeup. But never mind. Her friends were going 
to find out sooner or later.
       Jo tried to get her makeup done quickly in front of the mirror 
whilst Ally spent her time in the stall. But she was having difficulty 
concentrating and couldn't cover up such a large area of her skin in such 
little time. Ally came out, washed her hands and took Jo by surprise. 
"What are you doing?"
Jo lowered her foundation carrying hand to one side abruptly.
"Nothing."
"You know you look fine without extra makeup." Ally remarked.
This distracted Jo long enough for Ally to grab the foundation from her 
friend's unsuspecting hand. It only took Ally a few moments to put two 
and two together. 
 "Why are you trying so hard to cover this up?" she paused briefly as a 
new idea dawned. "How much more of that purple mark is already 
covered up?"
Jo glanced around her. The girl's toilets were surprisingly empty for this 
time of day.
"Fine! I'll tell you. Yesterday Cally got angry."
"Uh oh." 
Ally knew of her sister's rage. When it got out of control you needed to 
be at least a mile away from her to avoid the aftermath.
"Yeah, she got really angry. At first it was with mum, but then she 
turned on me. This purple-" Jo stroked her cheek gently, still wincing. "is 
part of a bruise that covers my face. I got it from when she threw mum's 
heels at me last night."
Ally's mouth gaped open.
"Jo you can't hide this! Have you told your dad?"
"Yes, but he's busy with work. He's concerned but doesn't have the 
time to help. I'm staying the week at his house."
"Well at least that's something."
Jo sensed the disapproval in her friend's voice.
"There's nothing I can do about Cally, siblings will be siblings." Jo sighed.
"But what if this happens again? You can't let her get away with it! Next 
week you'll be at your mum's house and then what?"
"I'll improvise."
"No Jo. That's not good enough."
"Don't tell the others. Please?" she begged.
"Jo I'm definitely telling the others. You can't keep this a secret 
forever!" Ally was honest; it was one of the reasons why Jo liked her, 
however sometimes it came across rather bluntly. "You should tell a 
teacher."
"No!"
"Jo you're the goody-two-shoes out of my friends, what's the harm? 
You tell teachers stuff all the time."
"Contributing in class is different."
"What about that time when Ettie was getting bullied? You told the 
teacher about that. Next thing you knew Dolph was in so much trouble! 
You need to get help. Hell, Cally needs help if she does that kind of thing 
when she gets angry."
"I don't know..."
"Well I do know; you're coming with me to the nurse's office right 
NOW."
Jo knew there was no arguing with Ally when she had her mind set on 
something. Ally took her arm and tugged her out of the toilets 
forcefully. 
	It didn't take them long to get to the nurse's office and soon 
they were waiting outside. Ally stayed with Jo to ensure that she didn't 
try to sneak off but they found that they were kept waiting for a while. 
Eventually Mrs Richardson came out of the nurse's room. 
"Looks like part of Yasmine's story was true." Ally whispered.
Jo nodded. Mrs Richardson truly looked as if she'd just encountered a 
ghost and from all the stories currently circulating the school she might 
well have done.
"What are you two doing here?" the teacher snapped.
"Waiting for the nurse." said Ally. Mrs Richardson looked like she was 
about to say something else to Jo but then the nurse called the pair in. 
"I'll see you later." Ally told Jo.
"What! Aren't you going to come in with me?"
"You're a big girl Jo. I'm sure you'll manage."
Jo glared as her friend walked off, but part of her knew Ally was right. 
       Jo walked into the cream coloured room and picked a spot to sit 
down. The nurse sat on a swivelling chair beside her desk. Quite frankly 
it creeped Jo out, it looked like something out of that James Bond 
movie. She was just waiting for the nurse to spin round stroking a cat.
"How can I help you?" she asked.
For a minute Jo was puzzled, couldn't the school nurse see the 
problem? Then she remembered that she had covered up the majority 
of her bruise with makeup. 
"Oh erm...have you got a sink?" she asked. Looking slightly confused the 
nurse pointed round the corner to another set of toilets. Jo rushed over, 
found a sink and began the painful process of washing off the makeup. 
When she returned the woman let out a gasp. "You see my problem." 
said Jo.
"When did you get that bruise?"
"Yesterday."
"How did you get that bruise?"
"It -it was an accident." Jo lied.
The nurse did not look convinced by the teen's stutter. She approached 
Jo and gently stroked the purple on her face with the tip of one finger.
"Does this hurt?"
Jo winced.
"Yes."
The nurse sat back down.
"Have you been feeling dizzy or disorientated at all since the time you 
received this bruise?"
"A little. On the way over to my dad's house I found it difficult to put 
one foot in front of the other." Jo remarked.
The nurse looked concerned at this news. She sighed.
"How did it happen?"
"My sister accidentally threw my mum's heels at me."
Jo put emphasis especially on the word 'accidentally'. She knew for a 
fact it hadn't been an accident but that didn't mean she had to tell the 
world. Things would only get worse between her and Cally then. As if 
their sisterly relationship wasn't bad enough.
"How can you 'accidentally' throw shoes into someone's face?" 
questioned the nurse, Jo could hear the quotation marks in her speech.
She knew it was a rather clumsy cover up but it was the best she could 
come up with for now.
"Ask her. Anyways, it's probably fine. My dad put some ice on it 
yesterday and I just relaxed on the couch. I'll just go now-" Jo began and 
stood up to leave.
"Wait." said the nurse. "I don't think you're telling me the entire truth. 
Do I need to call back that friend who was outside with you?" Jo 
reluctantly sat down. "Right. First of all, tell me your sister's name."
"Cally Sanders."
"Ah." That wasn't good. The nurse knew plenty of children who'd been 
sent to her office as a result of Cally's temper tantrums. She had heard 
of the girl on a fairly frequent basis. "Has your head been aching at all 
today?"
Jo frowned. 
"A little."
"Have you been finding it unusually difficult to concentrate in lessons?"
"Yes."
"I think you have a mild concussion. So I'll give you a mild painkiller to 
counter any symptoms you may be feeling." The nurse stood up and got 
a box out of the cupboard above her desk. She then removed a tablet 
from the packaging and passed it over to Jo. "Chew it thoroughly before 
you swallow."
Jo did as she was told.
"Thank you."
"You're welcome. I know you don't want to tell me everything but if you 
ever need to talk you have your friends and form tutor for that."
Jo barely managed to stop herself from rolling her eyes, what a school 
nurse thing to say. So she had a bruise on her face, it didn't mean she 
needed counselling.
"Okay."
And with that Jo left the room.
***
Cally felt bizarre. Ever since that lesson with Mrs Richardson she'd 
suddenly felt ill. She knew it wasn't because of the bleeding projector, 
she'd watched horror movies far grosser than that. She was exhausted 
but unsure as to why. 
       She'd met Dolph at lunch and he'd been nice enough to carry 
her tray for her. She ignored Kaela's protests that he was putting 
something in her food. Everyone seemed to be out to separate the 
couple. Why didn't they understand that they were perfect for each 
other? Cally would never admit it in public, let alone to herself but part 
of her was starting to love her boyfriend. Every time she saw Dolph she 
felt warm inside and happy no matter how rubbish the day had been. 
But after that lunchtime she had definitely begun to feel sick. During 
lunch she'd felt like she was on top of the world. She'd been wide 
awake, confident and her friends couldn't help but notice she was 
almost on the point of hyperactive. Cally had been willing to take any 
risk, although the amount of risks you could take in a canteen were 
rather limited. She smiled to herself.
"It must just be Dolph withdrawal." she remarked.
***
Rory had managed his time better yesterday and had got the report 
done before midnight. Linda too had managed to get home before 
midnight. Through their cooperation, although the pair was unaware of 
it, they managed to avoid another amusing chase through the police 
department yet both smiled fondly when they remembered that night. 
Today they were going to interview Dolph. Rory had got the address for 
his house only this morning and had looked up his record. The boy had 
already received several cautions for stealing but other than that had 
done nothing serious as far as he was aware. This little house visit would 
determine if he'd done anything else since his last offence, which was 
why it had to be done once school was finished for the day. If they 
wanted to interview the boy they had to at least arrive at the right time. 
It was this series of choices that led the pair to stand in front of number 
nineteen's door. 
       It was a rather grotty door that needed a new coat of paint. 
Linda knocked and a little more of the green colouring flaked off from 
its surface. They waited for several minutes then exchanged glances. 
Linda was about to knock again when the door opened. Dolph stood in 
front of them. 
"What do you want?" he asked bluntly.
"Is this the Andrews residence?" asked Linda ignoring his rude attitude.
"Yeah. Why?"
"Are you Dolph Andrews?"
"Maybe. Who wants to know?"
"I'm Officer Porter, this is Rory."
Rory was mildly surprised that she didn't refer to him by his surname as 
he would her, but he merely gave her a look to indicate his feelings 
instead of saying anything. Dolph eyed the policemen nervously. This 
was not good. He'd didn't think he'd done anything wrong lately but 
sometimes he did these things automatically. Once he'd started the 
occasional shoplifting it was difficult to stop, similarly to a lot of other 
things he did.
"Is it okay if we ask you a few questions?" said Rory.
"Actually I'm kind of busy at the moment -" Dolph began, using his 
answer as an opportunity to escape from the policemen.
"Let me rephrase, this is a rather urgent matter. We need you to answer 
a few questions." Linda cut in.
Dolph would have shut the door in their faces if his mother hadn't come 
up to him at that point.
"Oh, hello officers! I hope Dolph hasn't been causing any trouble-" she 
greeted in a friendly tone. Mrs Andrews paused to give her son a 
withering look. "-again."
Dolph groaned internally, now his mother was involved there was no 
way out. Linda however smiled; it was nice to meet somebody 
cooperative in her line of work.
"We don't know whether your son's involvement in our case is serious 
yet but we need to ask him a few questions."
"Okay, step right in. I'll make some tea."
Rory frowned at the mention of tea, he'd never liked the stuff but he 
felt it was rude to refuse. Linda stepped inside and led the way to the 
couch in the living room. Rory followed her. He'd never interviewed 
somebody in their home. Sure he'd done it on the scene, in the 
interrogation room reserved for such things at the police department 
and in the hospital (as of yesterday) but never at the person's home. 
This would certainly be a new experience.
	As soon as the policemen were out of earshot Dolph's mother 
heightened herself and stared into her son's eyes.
"Dolph Geraint Andrews if you have been stealing so help me I will 
ground you for a month - understand!?" she snapped.
"Yes." Dolph replied nodding meekly. 
His mother was the only person who could make him behave. So 
naturally he tried to ensure that she never had to discover what he got 
up to at school. Letters sent home got shredded before she could get 
her hands on them, the school didn't have the correct phone number 
for Mrs Andrews and even their address details were incorrect. Dolph 
was thorough; he liked to make sure no stone was left unturned. 
However he couldn't affect a criminal record no matter how hard he 
tried. So his solution was to not get caught in the first place. This 
interview was going to be brief but vitally important. Dolph knew he 
had to choose his answers carefully however that didn't mean he 
would. As a rule, he virtually never thought before he spoke.
	He joined the policemen on the armchair next to the couch. 
Linda had produced a notebook and was scribbling in the top right hand 
corner of the page in an attempt to unnerve Dolph. So far it seemed to 
be working.
"How is your relationship with Cally Sanders coming along?" asked Rory.
"What's that got to do with anything?" Dolph asked faking 
bewilderment.
He knew exactly what it had to do with him but wasn't about to admit 
that. The safest option for him right now was to feign innocence.
"Answer the question."
"I like her and she likes me. It's as simple as that."
"How well do you know her friends?"
"I try to avoid them most of the time. Especially Di, god that girl is 
irritating!" Dolph replied a little too honestly. 
He realised only afterwards that he'd let slip his dislike of Diane. Linda's 
hand was writing ferociously producing an unintelligible scrawl many 
people at the police department knew her well for. 
"Why did you not get on with Diane?"
It was too late to backtrack now.
"She always said shit about me." Dolph muttered.
"Care to expand on that?"
Dolph didn't particularly care. But he knew he had little choice. His 
mother was probably watching him from the kitchen now. She always 
knew when he was lying. If he didn't give himself away she would.
"Di said I shouldn't go near Cally, told me I was a jerk all the time and 
then accused me of something stupid."
"What did she accuse you of?"
"She said I was bloody drug dealer! Can you believe that?" Dolph 
exclaimed.
Rory couldn't. The kid was a little rude and aggressive but he was not 
the type to deal drugs; at least not as far as the he was aware. However 
Rory knew he couldn't afford to judge people in these situations. That 
was what he'd done with the five year old murder case and look where 
that embarrassing mishap had got him.
	It was at this point that the boy's mother walked into the room 
armed with tea. Rory eyed it distastefully but took a cup all the same. 
Linda gladly took hers and started to sip it instantly. 
"You're thirsty." commented Mrs Andrews.

















Chapter 4
"Mmm, that's some really good tea." The mother smiled. "I think we are 
pretty much done here but I just want to make a few final checks. Is it 
okay with you if we search the house?"
Mrs Andrews pursed her lips and gave her son a look but sighed.
 "You might as well."
"Thank you. Don't worry; we'll be out of your hair in no time."
Linda started to go upstairs and Rory followed. Dolph watched them 
wistfully. The last thing he wanted was to be left alone with his mother. 
He pretty much knew she'd been watching them.
       "What do you think?" Rory asked Linda.
"I think we should check his bedroom first."
"Together? Wouldn't it be faster if we did separate rooms?"
"Yes but we cover things more thoroughly when we do it together. 
That's why you're assigned to this case in the first place. I make 
mistakes that you need to keep an eye on, or at least correct."
Rory sighed. That answered Mark's rather insistent question. Part of 
him had been hoping that maybe she kept him around for more 
unprofessional reasons. Rory had been hoping that maybe she just liked 
his company, as much as he liked hers. Perhaps that was a little too 
much to hope for.
	Dolph's room was marked clearly with a keep out sign 
decorated by childishly scribbled ammo shooting down a would be 
intruder on the paper. They ignored it and opened the door to reveal a 
mess. The room looked like a hurricane had just blustered through it. 
School clothes, casual clothes, comics, stationary, toys and pretty much 
everything Dolph owned seemed to be scattered about the floor. You 
couldn't even see the carpet underneath. Rory wondered whether there 
was a carpet underneath. How could this kid sleep at night? He 
wondered quietly to himself. Linda was thinking along the same lines. 
She knew that if she was a mother she would be horrified, and she 
already felt a little disgusted. How could someone live like this? She 
winced. This could take longer than she'd thought. 
"Better get started."
Rory ducked down onto the floor and started to delve through a nearby 
pile of rubbish that seemed to have gathered next to the bedside 
instead of a bin. After several minutes of this he was able to see under 
the bed. There was nothing of interest under it but the bed was always 
a prime suspect for hiding unwanted items in these cases. He started to 
search through the mattress, removing the layer of junk that covered it 
and placing the pile in the corridor where there was actually space. As 
they worked Dolph's mother came upstairs and watched their progress 
with a bemused expression on her face.
"Good luck."
"Is his room always like this?" Rory exclaimed.
"Pretty much. Hopefully having his stuff dumped in the corridor will 
force him to tidy up his room. I've tried everything, honestly he seems 
to hate cleanliness as much as a -" she paused trying to think of a 
metaphor.
"A very mucky dog?" Rory suggested.
The woman laughed. 
"I suppose that comparison will do for the time being."
"We might be a while."
"I guessed. You can stay for as long as you like, but I've got to go to 
work in a few hours' time."
"Ok. Thanks."
She stood there for a few minutes watching the police search through 
her son's room before going downstairs.
	Rory started to peer through a pile of comics as she left.
"Beano! I remember these! You can't go wrong with a good comic." 
He began to flip through the pages.
"Rory do you want to be here for the entire day?" Linda asked.
"If I spend the entire day reading these then yes." he replied stubbornly.
As he glanced at the pile of comics he realised there was enough of 
them for him to stay the day.
"Well I want to go home."
"Oi! You never know, you could find drugs inbetween the pages. That is 
what we're looking for right?"
"Right." she said sounding a little sad.
"What's up?"
"My husband loved Beano too."
"Oh."
       Every policeman in the department knew about Linda Porter's 
tragic marriage. Linda and Michael Porter had been soul mates. The pair 
had truly loved each other and nothing was able to tear them apart. 
Except when her husband's body turned up in a ditch in the middle of 
nowhere mauled horribly. It had broken Linda's heart when her 
husband died, it happened on the way home from the school he worked 
at. She hadn't stopped crying for several days. But she still came into 
work, so everyone saw. That is, until her co-workers ganged up on her 
and forced the woman to take a few days off to recover a little from the 
emotional trauma. Linda returned after those few days looking slightly 
more rested. She looked worse for wear on the day of his funeral 
undoubtedly but that was only to be expected. Ever since her husband 
died she was determined to stop anyone else from suffering a similar 
fate. However after several weeks in the office Linda realised that 
wasn't physically possible with the amount of crime in London and her 
behaviour seemed to return to normal. Her armour had hardened. But 
occasionally you could still catch glimpses of the old, more carefree, 
vulnerable Linda. It was rare and you had to catch her at the right 
moment but Rory knew it was worth it. Her grieving had begun when he 
arrived at the police department about a month ago but it was barely a 
day ago he'd seen her smiling as she chased him.
"He just loved comics in general. Michael was a bit of a geek sometimes. 
He wanted to attend conventions for them and everything." She smiled 
a little at the memory. "Of course he forced me to come with him and 
against my will I found myself enjoying it all."
Rory felt rather uncomfortable as Linda continued to pour out her heart 
to him. She shouldn't be talking to him about these things. He was just 
around at the right moment, that didn't mean he was the right person 
to tell. He flipped through the comics a little more frantically looking for 
a distraction. Since he was not really reading the pages properly he got 
through the pile far quicker than he would've done normally. He was 
near the bottom when a packet fell out from the comic annual he was 
skimming. Glad for the excuse to steer the conversation away from 
Linda's past love life he jumped at the opportunity to point out the 
white powder.
"Look at this!"
She wandered over to his side.
"Is that cocaine?"
"You tell me, you're the expert."
She took the packet from his hands and fingered the plastic material 
housing the substance curiously. After a little more close examination 
Linda came to a decision.
"That's cocaine."
"Maybe Diane was right."
"Either way we need to bring that boy into the police station. If he 
possesses this kind of drug we can't simply let him stay at home and get 
away with it. This is illegal."
"Whoa we don't know whether it's on him!"
"In his bedroom then. It's worth searching him as well though either 
way."
"We need to tell his mother."
"She'll see us search him and will put two and two together. She's not 
stupid."
And with that they set off downstairs. By the time the pair got to the 
couch in the living room however there was no sign of Dolph. They 
followed the sound of clattering plates into the kitchen but only found 
his mother washing up. 
"Can I help you officers?" she asked glancing up to look at them from 
over the sink.
"Where is your son?" questioned Linda.
"Oh he said he was just going out for a bit." Mrs Andrews replied.
"He's under arrest. Next time you see him you call us." Rory informed 
her.
Mrs Andrews sighed wearily but it was clear to the pair that part of her 
had been expecting this. 
"Oh dear. Okay. Why is he under arrest?"
"We found cocaine inside one of his comics." Rory informed.
"WHAT!?" she exclaimed.
Rory jumped. However Linda didn't react. She was relatively used to this 
whereas Rory was effectively a newbie in this kind of situation. Linda 
liked to think that she was Rory's work experience. Anyways, she had 
dealt with overprotective parents before; this one simply seemed 
startled and worried for her son's wellbeing. In a way this made their 
job a lot easier. Mrs Andrews was a lot more manageable if she wasn't 
in denial. Linda gave the woman a few seconds to calm down before 
asking her another question.
"Where do you think he would go if he knew someone was onto his 
little secret?"
"Probably to see Lolita. He goes to her flat all the time."
"Lolita?" Rory and Linda said in unison.
"She's his sister." The pair exchanged glances. "Is that a bad thing?"
"No of course not." Linda reassured. 
Rory thought his superior was lying. Lolita's case was still talked about in 
the police department when he arrived. She had been jailed for a couple 
of years as a result of an offence similar to the one Dolph had 
committed. They'd found out in court that her druggie boyfriend hadn't 
been helping matters. He too had been put in prison. But that was all in 
the past now. It was an old record but quite memorable. Rory had been 
sure to do a little 'research' on Dolph's family when Linda told him 
they'd be paying a visit to the Andrews. Hopefully the girl had moved on 
from her boyfriend and her dodgy activities. Her criminal record had 
been suspiciously quiet ever since that incident. 
"Where does Lolita live?" questioned Rory.
"A few blocks away: number 12, Golding Road."
"Thank you for your help Mrs Andrews. We'll be sure to inform you if 
there are any other developments."
The mother nodded, still looking shocked that Dolph had dared to defy 
the law in such a way, and the pair left.
       The police officers walked down the street. It was not the 
prettiest of sights, what with the rain pouring down in torrents. It 
darkened the skies, greyed the houses but worst of all, it drenched their 
uniforms. It truly was miserable weather. Rain never failed to annoy 
Linda. In fact she was an easy person to irritate but unfortunately for 
Rory it was difficult for him to keep his distance considering he had to 
stand right next to her if he wanted to see to Dolph and his sister. As 
they made their way through the gloomy streets the occasional car 
drove past splashing the dirty water at passers-by. Since Rory and Linda 
were the only people stupid enough to be out in the weather without 
some kind of coat they found that their trouser legs quickly became 
saturated. Linda let out a low rumble of a groan and Rory shook his fist 
at the car as it drove off into the distance. They were glad when they 
finally spotted the street sign for Golding Road. It was well hidden by 
surprisingly grey greenery. This was due to the dull lighting of the 
clouded skies. Fortunately it did not take them long to find number 12 
in amongst everything. They stood outside the flat and fought for the 
sheltered position on the doorstep. By this point Rory didn't care if she 
was his superior, he just wanted to get out of the rain. After several 
minutes of this Linda won and pressed the appropriate button. 
"Hello who's this?" came a voice through the small speaker.
"I'm Officer Porter, here with a fellow policeman. Is Dolph Andrews with 
you?"
"Nope."
"Is it okay if we come in and ask you a few questions?"
"Actually I'm kind of busy at the moment."
The officers exchanged glances. That was exactly the same excuse Dolph 
had used. It could just be coincidence, but what if it wasn't?
"We'll only be a few minutes."
"Sorry you're not coming in."
"We can get a search warrant if necessary."
"Good for you." 
Lolita stopped paying attention to the pair.
"Hello? Hello!" Linda turned to Rory. "She's not going to let us in 
willingly."
"By the time we are able to get a search warrant Dolph will have gone. 
Our best bet is to wait outside the flat for him to leave." Rory suggested.
"A stakeout in this weather?" Linda spluttered.
"You go back to the station and get our coats. I'll wait here."
"Rory you'll get pneumonia." 
"I'll survive if you're quick." He flashed her a grin. "Go on."
"Fine. But if you die from hypothermia it's not my fault."
Linda set off at a run and Rory began the wait. 
***
Lolita closed the curtains to the flat windows and turned to face Dolph. 
Her dark hair hung over her eyes in a side parting but he could tell that 
underneath the strands she was glaring at him through the smoky fog of 
the flat. Now the windows were all closed along with the curtains the 
swirling smoke from her cigarettes were confined to the room. She 
walked over to Dolph. 
"Wanna tell me why you're on the run?" she asked her little brother 
blowing a waft of smoke into his face.
"Nope." Dolph said stubbornly, before coughing. 
His eyes stung but he was used to the stench by now.
"I just covered for you I think it's my business now. Tell me. It's a 
statement not a question." 
Dolph knew he should tell her. His sister could get pretty scary if she 
didn't get what she wanted.
"Fine. You know back when you were dating Roy-"
Lolita's eyes widened. She'd dumped that jerk a long time ago but 
despite all of his flaws he'd been a very influential git.
"Oh please tell me you didn't!"
"You know I got along with him well. Plus you know how huge his stash 
was. Don't act so surprised."
"So the cops are after you for illegal drug possession. Great. What made 
you think I wouldn't turn you in?"
"Because you know how it feels."
Dolph could tell from the look on her face that he'd won that side of the 
argument.
"Well you can't camp out here forever. You heard those cops; they'll get 
a search warrant. Where are you going to go?"
"Where did you go?"
"I didn't have to run. You know that. Your girlfriend was the person who 
convinced me I needed help!" Lolita said angrily. "She's too good for 
you anyways, why are you dating her?"
"Why does everybody keep saying that!?" Dolph exclaimed.
"So I'm not the first to notice then. I know what you're like Dolph, hell I 
know what men in our family are like, dad's a right player. Although 
mum pretends not to notice. So are you. Yet you've been stuck to Cally 
like a leech, care to explain why?"
"Maybe I love her!"
Lolita gave her brother a scorching look.
"Nope, I'm not buying it."
"Worth a try." Dolph sighed. Part of him knew that Lolita wouldn't have 
been fooled that easily. "Look I've been working on something with her, 
it's important."
"Does she know any of this?"
"God you're worse than mum!" he complained.
"I'm the big sister. It's my job."
"If I told her I was only interested in her for two reasons she'd dump me 
in an instant. Or - do something worse."
"What do you mean?"
"I've been setting her up for all of this; I should know what happens 
when she gets angry."
"What are you talking about?"
"Look, can I stay here for a while? I promise I'll be out of your hair as 
soon as possible."
Lolita narrowed her eyes. 
"How soon is as soon as possible?"
"I'll stay the night."
"Nope - too long. The most time you're getting out of me is an hour max 
and you've already used up most of it."
She turned away.
"Please Loli!" Dolph begged.
Lolita whipped around.
"DON'T CALL ME THAT." Dolph knew he'd crossed the line using that 
nickname. Only Roy ever called her that and to be honest it was obvious 
that despite her druggie jerk of a boyfriend she was still hung up on him 
like he was on crack. She knew the man was no good for her, but that 
didn't make getting over him any easier. "Get out." she snapped.
"What?"
Dolph didn't know why he sounded so surprised. Even he knew that he 
had that coming.
"You heard me." She grabbed him by the collar and shoved him towards 
the window. "Is the coast clear?"
He drew the curtains to one side and stared down through the glass.
"No."
Dolph could clearly see the policeman who'd come to his house that 
afternoon shivering in front of the entrance gate in the cold. Lolita 
rolled her eyes.
"Then deal with him! You've gotten into enough fights to know how."
"This is different, he's an adult."
"Oh for god's sake!" Lolita shrieked. She stormed over to a cupboard 
and retrieved a wine bottle. She pushed it into Dolph's hand. "Use your 
imagination!"
After that her brother made a run for it. He knew if he stuck around 
whilst his sister was in such a rage he wouldn't like where he ended up. 
The policeman was alone and looked pretty cold anyways. Lolita was 
right; it wouldn't take much to overpower the man.
***
Rory was freezing. Part of him was beginning to believe that Linda was 
right. At this rate he was bound to catch some kind of cold and it would 
be his own fault. He stamped his feet in an attempt to warm himself. It 
wasn't very effective. He started to pace up and down the pavement 
beside the gate. But this meant that for a few seconds he had his back 
to the flat. So he didn't see the teenager leaving the house, he didn't 
see the boy charge towards him and he didn't see the bottle raised 
above his head until it was too late.
***
It took a while for Linda to get back to the police station. She'd got a bit 
lost on the way there; her navigational skills weren't the best the 
department had to offer. But her proudness ensured that she didn't ask 
for directions. She didn't want to give anyone the excuse to ridicule her. 
By the time she finally arrived it had been at least five minutes. She felt 
rather guilty about leaving Rory out in the torrential rain for that long. 
Linda grabbed the coats and then set off in her car. In any other 
circumstance she would've gone for a police car as the bright siren and 
lights guaranteed a clear passage through London but since they were 
aiming for stealth this time she drove back to the flat in her regular car. 
Naturally, she got caught up in traffic and every minute she spent just 
sitting there waiting for the queue to budge allowed her another minute 
to worry about Rory. She knew she was being silly, he was a grown man; 
he knew what he was doing. But she just had this bad feeling. Linda 
couldn't define it but she felt like something was wrong. Then again, she 
got the same feeling whenever she went to the toilet (she saw too many 
horror movies as a child, long story). It was probably another case of 
pointless paranoia that she seemed to get far too often these days. This 
thought calmed her down considerably and she felt herself relax in the 
driving seat. Eventually the line moved and she was able to get to the 
flat. She parked on the side of the pavement (one of the advantages of 
being head of the police department is that you're far less likely to get 
tickets) but her heart sank as she saw Rory sprawled out on the wet 
pavement.  She ran over to him. Judging by the saturation of his uniform 
he'd been lying there for a while. On the bright side at least she knew it 
wasn't pneumonia that had felled him. There were shards of glass 
strewn around his head. One chunk clearly read: white wine. Using her 
shoe she kicked the stray pieces away from him before kneeling at his 
side.
"Rory can you hear me?" He let out a low moan. Linda let out a sigh of 
relief. "Thank god. Are you okay?"
He tried to sit up but fell back.
"What does it look like?" he groaned. "I feel like an upturned turtle."
She smiled. That was more like it. She placed her arm around his back 
for support.
"Up in three okay? One, two, three!" With her help Rory stood up. He 
swayed slightly as he came to his feet. "Whoa, easy. Did you see who hit 
you?"
"Dolph." he murmured.
"That boy's in big trouble now. Drugs is one thing, but assaulting a 
police officer is going to have the department a lot more committed to 
finding him."
"Yeah." 
Linda could tell he hadn't processed any of the information she'd just 
told him. His eyes had that unfocussed look to them that meant he was 
far away.
"Come on, let's get you cleaned up."
Together they stumbled over to the car. Linda helped Rory get into the 
passenger seat beside hers and he did up his seatbelt as she sat down in 
the driving seat.
***
Aileen had just got home from work. Cally was still not back from school 
yet. She was probably taking the long route with her friends. That was 
not unusual. She sighed as the phone rang and glared in its vague 
direction. She'd only just got home herself! She pondered whether she 
should pick it up or not as she collapsed onto the sofa. Finally the 
irritating ringtone stopped and the answerphone took the message.
"Hello. This is Doctor Snelling and we've belatedly found out something 
rather alarming in your daughter's test results. Please call me back as 
soon as-"
Aileen's eyes widened, she ran towards the phone and grabbed it 
cutting off the doctor mid-sentence.
"Hello, sorry I was just in the kitchen." she lied. "What were you 
saying?"
"I was re-analysing your daughter's test results and we've found traces 
of a rather dangerous drug in her system."
"WHAT!?" Aileen yelled down the phone. Finding out about her 
daughter's weekend parties had been worrying enough but now? What 
else had Cally been keeping secret from her? There was silence on the 
other end of the line for a few minutes. "Sorry, continue."
"It was cocaine. Has your daughter been showing any of the following 
symptoms lately?" Aileen listened carefully as the man started to list 
them. "Mental alertness, increased energy, mood disturbances, 
confidence, paranoia, irritability, aggressiveness or careless risk taking."
Aileen frowned. It was virtually all of the above. 
"Aggressiveness and mood disturbances most definitely, paranoia yes," 
she said as she remembered how Cally seemed to think everyone was 
out to get her and her boyfriend. "irritability yes, confidence yes,"
She would've continued but the doctor interrupted her.
"I think it's safe to assume your daughter has been taking cocaine."
Aileen was speechless. But it didn't last long.
"What do I do?" she asked.
"I would suggest searching her room and confiscating the drug if you 
find any of it."
"What does it look like?"
"It'll most likely be a form of white powder."
"Okay, any other suggestions?"
"Talk to her, and I don't mean yell, I mean hold an intervention if 
necessary. Talk about the impacts drugs can have on your life, lecture 
her about health and remind her that you're only telling her this 
because you love her." Aileen frowned. That was more of her husband's 
way to go about things. She did the yelling, he did the understanding 
but between them they both shared out the care. Aileen didn't always 
show it however. "Ask her about her friends, quite often peer pressure 
forces kids into these things."
"Okay. Thank you for your help Doctor Snelling."
Aileen hung up. She'd only just put the phone down when Cally entered 
the house. Just typical; well, better get it done and over with, she 
thought to herself. Aileen ran round to the front door and stood in front 
of her daughter. 
"Cally I need to talk to you."
"Not now mum." she croaked.
"Cally this can't wait." On hearing this news Cally ducked underneath 
Aileen's outstretched arms and started to run. "Cally are you taking 
drugs?" Aileen blurted out.
She didn't even think her daughter had heard her. Cally ran upstairs. 
Her mother sighed. She wasn't very good at this. It was all about finding 
the right moment. So she went into the study, sat down and started to 
research the best ways to help her daughter. Aileen thought Cally was 
going to her bedroom but she couldn't have been more wrong.
 	Cally skidded into the bathroom, locked the door behind her 
and hung her head over the toilet. She felt REALLY sick. Sick enough to 
be sick which was why she was kneeling in front of the loo. The 
exhausted feeling seemed to overwhelm her. She sagged over the toilet 
seat, her neck touching the cool surface. It was shockingly cold in 
comparison to the warmth of Cally's skin. Finally she threw up into the 
toilet. She closed her eyes, not wanting to examine the contents. When 
she opened them again however she was disturbed to notice that the 
filth her stomach had produced was pitch black. That was not normal. 
She got to her feet dizzily and flushed the toilet. Cally staggered to the 
mirror. Her face was pale and sweaty and she felt so tired. Her 
reflection seemed to blur in the mirror before her and then everything 
went black.
	Downstairs Aileen heard a loud thud. She shook her head and 
wondered what her daughter was throwing about the room this time. 
She'd obviously not had a very good day at school from the way she'd 
reacted to her mother when she entered the house. Aileen hoped she 
wasn't wrecking anything expensive.
***
Dolph was still running. He needed to find a way out; somewhere to go. 
He knew that by now there was only one option and he just had to hope 
the police hadn't visited her yet to warn the family of the danger he 
posed. He knew for a fact that she'd be in a pretty bad state by this 
point. He knocked on Cally's door, desperately hoping that Jo wasn't 
there to kick him out but to his surprise instead of one of the girls 
opening it their mother did.
"Hello Dolph." she greeted.
He frowned slightly; the girls always beat their mother to the door.
"I need to see Cally."
Aileen's eyes narrowed. What if this youngster was part of it all?
"Why?"
"She's my girlfriend. She said she was feeling a little poorly after lunch. I 
want to see her." Dolph explained. 
Of course that wasn't his real reason but it made him sound a lot more 
caring. Aileen's expression softened.
"Come in. She's in her bedroom."
He smirked, he was getting better at this whole lying thing. Dolph 
dashed inside not bothering to keep the caring façade up. Fortunately 
for him Aileen mistook his determination for wanting to see his 
girlfriend. In a way, she was right. 
	Dolph walked into Cally's bedroom but to his surprise there was 
no sign of her.
"Cal?" he called. No reply. He checked several other bedrooms before 
trying the bathroom, knocking on the door first. "Cally? You in there?" 
Again there was no reply. He tried the door handle. It was locked. Aileen 
was downstairs and now that he thought about it he remembered Cally 
saying something earlier that day about her no-good sister staying at 
her father's house. The only person who could be in the bathroom was 
Cally. So he started to pick the lock. There was a reason why he got 
away easily with most of his thefts. After a few minutes the door swung 
open to reveal Cally lying on the floor unconscious.  He sighed in 
irritation. It had begun. He just hoped his plan worked before she dried 
herself out. Dolph walked into the bathroom and locked the door 
behind him. It was just them now.
***
"Linda stop fussing I'm fine!" complained Rory. "Don't you have a case 
to solve? Or a murder suspect to catch? You need to tell Cally's parents 
about her boyfriend."
She eyed the bandage wrapped round his head.
"Are you sure? That was one nasty knock you took." 
He sighed. This was not the first time they'd had this conversation. 
"It was one lousy bump don't worry about it. Can I go home now?"
"Okay. But I'm driving you."
"What?! I'm not a baby!" he exclaimed.
"Well that's news to me." Linda teased. "Didn't the doctor tell you not 
to drive anyways?"
"Yes." Rory admitted.
"Then come on."
"Oi!" he protested. Then he paused, perhaps he could use this moment 
to his advantage. "I'm only letting you drive if you promise to go give 
Cally's parents a house visit. Each."
Linda groaned but agreed.
"Let's get you home."
She took him by the hand and started to lead him out of the police 
department. Mark, who sat only a few desks away, raised an eyebrow. 
Rory simply rolled his eyes. Linda was acting a little overprotective as far 
as he was concerned and she knew it, but in doing so she was letting her 
guard down a little and the professionally strict feel about her was 
melting away. Trust Mark to get the wrong idea.
	Eventually they were stepping into Rory's car. He gave her the 
car key reluctantly and she put it in the ignition. The engine started to 
rumble and they set off.
"Linda?" he asked.
"Yes?" she responded.
"Why am I assigned to this case?"
She sighed.
"I already told you, it's because you correct my mistakes and you owe 
me."
"Surely you owe me by now." he pointed out. "After today-"
Linda winced. He was using the guilt persuasion technique and it was 
working. She'd left him alone for five minutes and look what had 
happened. 
"Sorry." she apologised.
Rory backtracked, maybe that wasn't such a good point to make.
"It's not your fault, it was my idea." Linda still felt responsible however. 
He was her partner. She was meant to keep an eye out for him and vice 
versa. He hadn't failed his part of the bargain. Rory sensed that she was 
unconvinced. "You can't be responsible for everything."
"It's a bad habit of mine." 
"Well you need to stop it."
"I'm head of the police department it's my job to be responsible."
"You need to relax once in a while though." Rory insisted.
"If I relax something gets past me."
"You were never like this before Michael died."
"Don't say his name." Linda snapped.
Rory gulped. He had a feeling he'd crossed the line.
"Sorry." he apologised.
"I'm sorry, you're right. I just miss him so much. When I first saw that 
girl's body I recognised the injuries.  It was mauled just like his was. I 
want to capture the person who's responsible so badly."
"You can only do that if you give yourself a break."
"I guess you're right. But that's not going to happen."
They continued in silence for a bit.
"Why did you really get me on this case Linda? Answer me honestly. 
Please."
"You remind me of my husband in many ways, you know how to cheer 
me up, you know how to calm me down, everything. I know, it's selfish 
but there's the reason. Having you round keeps me sane." Rory found 
that he had very little to say to that. He reminded his superior of her 
husband? That was...freaky and slightly annoying. He wanted to be 
himself, unique, not a copy of some guy he was jealous of anyways. 
Jealous? Where did that come from? Was he jealous of Michael? He 
knew the answer was yes almost instantly but he wasn't sure why. The 
guy was dead for Christ's sake! The car came to a stop. "Here you are." 
Linda parked it in the drive. 
"Thanks." Rory said.
He got out and proceeded to walk to his house. He had a lot to think 
about. Maybe, just maybe, Mark was right.
***
It was done. Dolph slapped her face. Hard. At this gesture Cally's eyelids 
flickered open.
"Dolph?" she gasped. "What are you doing here?"
"I came to see you. Duh!"
"W-what am I doing on the floor?" she stuttered and got to her feet. 
Dolph remained sitting on the tiles watching her totter towards the 
bathroom door.
"I dunno." He shrugged. "Look, listen to me I need you."
To Cally this sounded romantic, but that was not what Dolph had in 
mind.
"I need you too. Dolph, I think I -"
His eyes widened in alarm at the thought of incoming commitment and 
he quickly cut her off.
"Can I hole up here for a few days?"
Cally was surprised by his request but pleased nonetheless. Maybe he 
was having Cally withdrawal symptoms similar to her own for him that 
afternoon?
"You can stay here for as long as you want."
"Great." he said getting to his feet. 
Dolph strolled past her and out of the bathroom. Cally staggered after 
him. She was beginning to feel confident again, like she was on top of 
the world. Now he was by her side she could take any risk. Letting him 
stay was going to be a big one, making sure her mother didn't know 
would be easy enough but when her bratty sister came back to stay at 
the house in a few days' time things would get difficult. But Cally was 
willing to go through it all. Her Dolph was addictive.
"I'll try and make space for you in the bedroom but sleeping 
arrangements could be fiddly..." she started to explain.
"I'll sleep with you." Dolph announced abruptly.
"What?!" Cally exclaimed. 
She was just a teenager and despite her will to risk anything attitude 
even she thought that was a bad idea. School was constantly preaching 
about stuff Cally didn't particularly want to think about, this was one of 
those things. The rumours constantly going round gave her a feeling 
that Dolph had knocked girls up before.
"You promised me that at the party on Saturday anyways." he 
reminded.
"I was drunk Dolph."
"But you meant it."
"Fine! You can sleep in my bed. But no funny stuff! You can keep your 
clothes on too thank you very much."
Dolph groaned. He felt cheated of a good night. At least he was halfway 
there. Besides, once the stuff he'd given her in the bathroom kicked in 
he'd be able to do whatever he wanted with her whether she liked it or 
not. 
"CALLY! Dinner!" yelled Aileen.
"Got to go. You make yourself at home. I'll tell mum you've left."
Cally kissed him lightly on the cheek before she went downstairs.
        As she joined her mother at the dinner table suddenly Cally felt 
extreme happiness. Her boyfriend was staying over for the night! Why 
shouldn't she be happy? Maybe she should even celebrate! They could 
play music loud and dance together and - Her mother noticed the way 
her daughter seemed to flounce about the room as she came over. 
Mood disturbances. Just like Doctor Snelling had said. They started to 
eat.
"Cally. You know that thing I was trying to talk to you about earlier," 
Aileen began.
"What thing? Oh and by the way Dolph has left." Cally chirped.
Aileen raised an eyebrow, she didn't particularly care about Dolph's 
disappearance, and it was completely off topic. Suspiciously off topic, 
but it was probably just part of Cally's strange drug induced mood 
swings. In a way it was nice to know that this behaviour wasn't just 
hormones. This reminded her, time to get back to the point.
"I tried to tell you when you came in, oh never mind. I'm telling you 
now. Doctor Snelling phoned."
"Who's she?"
"He. Doctor Snelling is the person who analysed your latest test results."
"That must be such a bo-ring job!"
Aileen ignored this comment.
"Well interesting or not, the results were quite important."
"What did she say?"
"That you've been taking Cocaine."
"She's loopy!" Cally giggled. For some reason she just couldn't take that 
statement seriously. "You don't believe that do you mum?"
"Cally he's a doctor. He knows what he is doing."
"So do I. I'm not stupid mum."
"Cally you've been showing all the symptoms, don't lie to me. Tell me 
honestly, have you been doing drugs?"
Cally almost laughed aloud. 
"Don't you trust me?"
But then she felt angry. She wanted to hit something. How dare her 
mother accuse her of such a thing!
 "After this weekend, no. Now answer my question."
"WELL FOR YOUR INFORMATION NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN TAKING 
DRUGS!" Cally screamed.
Aileen took a deep breath and reminded herself of what the website 
said. It was only to be expected that her daughter would launch into 
some form of denial, or in Cally's case: explode, but at least one of them 
had to remain calm. Aileen was the adult, which meant she had to be 
the mature one. She sighed, this could be difficult.
"Cally you're in denial. Drugs kill."
"SO CAN CALPOL!"
"I'm only saying this because I love you."
"IF YOU LOVED ME MAYBE YOU WOULD TRUST ME! DOLPH LOVES ME, 
YOU DON'T! YOU'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH HAVEN'T YOU? YOU JUST 
DON'T TRUST ME! NOBODY DOES! EVERYBODY IS OUT TO GET ME! 
NOBODY CARES!"
"Then you won't mind me searching your bedroom."
Uh oh. Cally started to protest as loudly as she could in the hopes that 
maybe Dolph would hear her from upstairs.
"You can't SEARCH MY BEDROOM MUM. That's MY OWN PRIVATE 
SPACE that YOU ARE INVADING!"
Aileen ignored her daughter and began the climb up the steep staircase. 
Cally ran after her frantically hoping that Dolph had got the message. 
	It wasn't long until her mother opened the door to her 
bedroom. Cally held her breath and peered over her parent's shoulder. 
Dolph was nowhere to be seen. She let out a quiet sigh of relief.
"Thank god." Cally whispered. But the danger wasn't over yet. Aileen 
began to search the room. "You're not going to find anything!" Cally 
announced loudly.
Aileen threw up the covers of the duvet. A small transparent packet 
containing white powder lay under it. 
"Then what's this?" She approached her daughter trying not to let the 
anger show. "Would it really kill you to tell me the truth? This can kill 
you if you don't."
She remembered what the website had said. If she got angry then she 
should leave the conversation for the time being and come back to it 
later. So she stormed out of the room. Cally sat on the bed as her 
mother slammed the door.
"Dolph you can come out now." Her boyfriend fell out of the wardrobe. 
"Would you care to explain to me what that packet of drugs was doing 
on my bed?"
"Your mum's got the wrong idea." he said getting to his feet.
"Then what is it?"
"Flour." he replied lamely. "I needed it for food tech today at school; it 
must've fallen out of my pocket."
To his relief Cally seemed stupid enough to buy his excuse.
"I knew you wouldn't do something that idiotic." she smiled. Then her 
eyes bulged. "Uurgh I think I'm going to be sick!"

















Chapter 5
"Just think of swans."
"What?!" she exclaimed.
"Any distraction will do."
"Oh."
"For example the food fight I'm planning for tomorrow."
Dolph knew it was careless but he was still going to school in the 
morning. He needed to. His plan was slowly unfolding; he knew Cally 
was sufficiently prepared. Now he just needed to force her to face his 
enemies in the school canteen. If the police showed he could turn her 
on them.
"Food fight?" she murmured and swayed before him. He smirked. 
Looked like what he had given her was finally starting to kick in. It had 
taken long enough. "Dolph I - I - don't feel -" She fell backwards onto 
the bed. "What's happening to me?" 
He smiled and came towards her with a leering expression on his face.
"Don't worry Cal, I'm going to make it all better." he whispered.
***
Jo was late. By the time she arrived at her father's house it was getting 
dark. She crept inside wondering if she could pass off a lie about her 
having got back ages ago and him simply not noticing. Probably not. It 
was harder to look into her father's eyes and lie to him than it was with 
her mother and if she looked away he'd know she wasn't telling the 
truth. She'd just needed some time to think on the way home, 
unfortunately it had taken a little longer than expected due to 
unforeseen difficulties. Jo had a little more on her mind than she 
realised. So she decided to put together a little list:
1.	A good friend of mine died a few days ago and I saw her corpse.
2.	Cally blames me for it all.
3.	Mum knows about the parties.
4.	Cally collapsed at the weekend.
5.	My parents are one paper away from being officially divorced.
6.	Cally gave me a concussion.
7.	My friends are suspicious of me.
Jo thought that just about covered everything. Now she had something 
new to add to the list.
8.	Dad's going to be pissed off with me.
It was at times like these when she really missed Diane. Diane had 
listened, a trait most of Jo's friends were not known well for and she'd 
given really good advice. She knew it was selfish, but Jo missed her 
advice almost as much as she missed her friend. Jo found herself 
thinking back over the good times, when Diane was alive, before Cally 
had her temper tantrums, back when they'd been one happy family and 
prior to when Cally had been dating Dolph. Funnily enough her temper 
tantrums seemed to arrive barely weeks after she met him. Strange 
that.
	Jo slipped her shoes off and placed them on the rack before 
tiptoeing up to her bedroom. She was amazed that she'd got this far. If 
she was at her mother's house by now Aileen would be looming over 
her tapping her foot in anger and demanding to know what had kept 
her. She dumped her school bags in the bedroom and was considering 
whether she should do homework or not when her father popped his 
head around the door.
"Dinner's ready."
"Oh. I'll be down in a sec."
"Don't be too long." he warned and set off downstairs.
Jo sighed. It didn't look like he'd even noticed her lateness. Her father 
was too busy with work. That was part of the reason why their parents 
had broken up. Aileen claimed that John didn't have enough time for 
her. This dissolved into the usual arguments and Jo would hide under 
her bed covers as the two adults yelled downstairs. She missed the way 
their parents used to look at each other, with love in their eyes and 
happy smiles. Now when their eyes met they seemed to fill with angry 
fire and their faces had foul frowns written all over them. Cally would 
refuse to hide, but that didn't mean it wasn't affecting her. She told 
everybody she was fine, but around the same time the pair split up she 
started organising the weekend parties. Jo saw this as her new way of 
venting although Cally only got angry when her sister brought it up. 
	Her father never said much about his work and his study was 
strictly off limits to all those not wanting to die a painful death of guilt. 
John Sanders had such a way with that emotion. He could force it onto 
you no matter how little reason you had to feel it. Jo often wondered 
what could be so important it could split him away from her mother. 
Now she felt the wounded curiosity consuming her body more than 
ever. She walked out of her bedroom. Her father's study was just a few 
rooms away from hers at the end of the hall. The coast was clear. What 
did she have to lose? 
       Jo crept towards the door glancing nervously at the stairs every 
few minutes. Finally she was in front of it. Her hand reached out to the 
doorknob. She was sweating. It was ridiculous how much of an 
adrenaline rush she got from this one simple action. 
"I need to get out more." Jo murmured to herself.
She opened the door. Its loud foreboding creak made her hold her 
breath but her father did not come rushing upstairs. She stepped inside.
	The room seemed to be a miniature laboratory. It gleamed a 
bright white even without the light on. Test tubes were lined up neatly 
amongst the scrunched up piles of paper on the desktop. The multi-
coloured liquids in them glowed fluorescently giving the work space a 
rather eerie lighting. She took a step inside and noticed a dusty red 
helmet hanging off a coat hanger on the wall alongside goggles and lab 
coat. She would've explored further but then her father's voice made 
her jump.
"Come on Jo! Dinner's out." he called.
She grabbed a smaller piece of scrunched up paper from the bin (which 
was filled to the brim with them), stuffed it into her blazer pocket and 
raced downstairs closing the door carefully behind her so it wouldn't 
emit the same loud squeak it had on entry.
	She sat opposite her father at the dinner table. In an attempt to 
act casual she kept her eyes down, focussing on the table. It was new 
and the oak wood surface was so shiny it reflected her face. She glanced 
up and raised an eyebrow.
"Dad have you been polishing the table?"
It was not unknown for her father to do this.
"I might have." he said teasingly. Then he frowned. "Is it that obvious?" 
Jo laughed.
"It makes a damn good mirror."
He stared at the wood and started to beam.
"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"
At this a smile began to cover Jo's face. Her father's grins were rather 
infectious.
"Angelina Jolie?" she suggested.
Jo knew for a fact her father had a huge crush on the actress. It was the 
reason why the only films starring the her that they owned were kept a 
secret from Jo's mother. Aileen got jealous very easily.
"I was going to say you silly, but now you mention it-" he trailed off into 
a daydream.
"Dad?"
"Yes?"
"Food."
"Ah right."
With that brief reminder they started to chow down on the pie laid out 
before them. It looked like her father had finally got the settings on the 
microwave right. The pie was not too burnt and was even edible! Jo was 
impressed. John Sanders was notoriously bad at cooking even on the 
simplest levels. It was a little embarrassing sometimes. She had learnt 
the hard way never to invite friends round for tea at her father's house. 
That incident happened after shortly after John Sanders moved into his 
new house.
	A wave of nostalgia hit her at this memory and brought along a 
flurry of others. She remembered that time Cally had come home to her 
father's house, yelling about her day. Jo and Cally shared a bedroom 
and when her sister had barged in she prepared herself for the throwing 
of furniture (her preparation consisted of standing beside the wardrobe 
so she could use its wooden doors as protection) but instead Cally 
simply continued to shout. She glanced briefly at the light bulb on the 
ceiling. After a few minutes Cally went silent and it started to ooze a 
rather disgusting liquid. This memory reminded Jo a lot of the warped 
story Yasmine had described at lunchtime. By the time John Sanders 
came upstairs there was a puddle of the gunge on the floor. He 
attended to Cally first however, with one huge hug. She virtually fell into 
his arms, all of a sudden crying and exhausted. Once she was fully 
comforted he came over to the liquid on the floor. He dipped a finger in 
it and said that the light bulb was leaking oil. Jo had believed him at the 
time, knowing nothing about light bulbs, but even now she could 
remember spotting a knowing look in his eyes. He hadn't told them 
everything. This knowledge made her think back to her father's study 
she'd intruded on barely a few minutes ago. Her free hand clenched on 
the paper in her pocket as she swallowed her mouthful of meat.
"Dad what is your job like?" 
John glanced up at his daughter mid-chew.
"Boring." he mumbled.
Having had practise at understanding her father when he had his mouth 
full Jo was just about able to translate his word.
"Come on tell me something about it!" Jo insisted.
"Why so interested all of a sudden?" replied John who had neatly 
polished his plate with his mouth. 
Jo supressed a smile, her father had a most unruly appetite. This was 
rather unfortunate considering his cooking skills. Plus he was not known 
for his table manners. Eating was more of a race against time than a 
time for conversation so it was only natural that he was going to spray 
his lovely new table with stuff that didn't bear thinking about.
"Why so defensive?" she asked as he reached for seconds.
"Touché."
"Well?"
John gestured at the remainder of pie sitting on Jo's plate. For the 
moment it was rather neglected.
"Aren't you going to eat that?"
She rolled her eyes. He was avoiding the subject completely. As per 
usual.
"Maybe when you tell me a little about what you do for a living! You 
just disappear into your study for hours on end and I'm getting tired of 
it."
"Can I have your pie please?"
She could tell from the grin on her father's face that he was fooling 
around but this simply bugged her.
"NO. Dad why are you so secretive? It's just a job."
"I'm not being secretive; I just don't want to bore you with the details. 
Trust me; my work bores me on a day to day basis." he lied, shoving 
another spoonful of pastry into his mouth.
Jo didn't believe him. Her father was just as bad a liar as she was 
sometimes.
"Then why do you bother with it? You spend hours locked up in your 
little study."
"Don't call it that, study sounds oppressive. Think of it as my little 
studio."
"But it is oppressive! I virtually never see you because of that damn 
room!" Jo felt an edge of desperation coming into her voice. This was 
ridiculous. "Dad the most I know about anything you do is that it's 
something to do with the government."
"Well that's true." John remained infuriatingly calm.
"Oh come on! It's not like it's top secret!" 
"Actually I think you'll find it is." Jo's mouth hung open in a small 'o' 
shape. He surveyed her, in a way that made her want to apologise 
instantly for ever daring to protest, before pushing away his plate. 
"Speaking of work I have stuff to be getting on with. You can finish off 
my pie, I'm not really hungry."
He stood up and left the table. Jo was tongue tied. She had not been 
expecting that, of all revelations. She sighed. Jo had seen the look on his 
face, he was upset and she had a feeling he'd gone up to the study for 
more than just simple work reasons. Not that his work was that simple 
as far as she was concerned.
	She finished his slice of pie which only made her feel guiltier 
before going up to her bedroom. There, in the confines of her room, she 
took the sheet of crushed paper from her blazer pocket and unfolded it 
but before she could examine any of its content the doorbell rang. 
Knowing her father was busy, most likely avoiding her, Jo went to 
answer the door.
"Hello?"
She was surprised to find herself greeting Officer Porter. 
"I need to talk to your father."
"Is it about his work?" asked Jo with sudden interest.
"No." Linda noticed how the girl seemed to deflate when she heard that 
reply. "It's about your sister's boyfriend."
"Really?" 
Jo's eyes were suddenly twinkling.
"Yes. Is your father available?"
"Erm..." Jo glanced upstairs. "Not really. I can take a message."
Jo felt a little like an answerphone on saying those words but ignored 
the feeling and listened eagerly.
"Okay." said Linda reluctantly. "Dolph is on the run at the moment for 
criminal reasons. If any of your family see him please contact us."
"Criminal reasons?"
"We found cocaine in his bedroom." At the mention of 'we' Jo couldn't 
help but notice the absence of Rory by the officer's side. As for the 
cocaine situation she wasn't terribly shocked. In fact she felt rather 
smug. Hadn't she told Cally that Dolph was bad for her? Yes she had. 
Repeatedly. Now she'd finally be able to tell her sister to her face "I told 
you so". This visit from the police would unfailingly prove her point. 
However bearing in mind that she still had the bruise on her face from 
the heels she had a feeling that mocking Cally would be a bad idea. "You 
don't look that shocked." Linda commented.
"I wouldn't put it past Dolph to be that stupid." Jo replied.
"Well please tell your father. I'm just about to pay a visit to your 
mother's house."
"Sure."
Jo closed the door and walked back over to the dinner table. She knew 
she should probably tell her father about it straight away but she was 
also aware that facing him now would not be fun. As if she wasn't 
feeling guilty enough! There was no harm in looking at the crinkled 
paper she'd been on the verge of examining before. She flattened out 
the material on the shiny surface of the table and gasped. On the paper 
before her was a picture of a stranger's head. The person's eyes were 
leaking a disgusting black liquid that Jo thought seemed all too familiar. 
She found herself wincing at the sight of it. 
       The picture was labelled in great detail. It was an old diagram. 
Jo wondered why her father had thrown it away in the first place as 
he'd obviously gone to a lot of effort with the annotations. She squinted 
at the small, squished blocks of handwriting and tried to read her 
father's words. The first thing she read was the title as it was the largest 
bit of writing on the sheet and therefore the easiest part to read, 
although not necessarily to understand.
Ocular discharge
Jo guessed that this meant eye leakage in a more scientific language. 
Then she started to look at the labels.
Haemohydro (haemoglobin-hydrocarbon) is present.
Those bracketed words seemed familiar. Jo was sure they'd been 
mentioned in at least one science lesson at school. She thought about it 
in a bit more depth. Jo wasn't expecting to be successful so she 
surprised herself with her own scientific knowledge as she remembered 
that a hydrocarbon was a kind of fuel such as oil and that haemoglobin 
was something found in the blood.
Tear glands have been infected by telekinesis. Or something tele-like.
What? Now that made no sense whatsoever. Jo was beginning to 
understand why her father had thrown this sheet away.
Calculations show the person implicating the damage will have struck 
from approximately a metre away without physically touching the 
victim.
Below this were various sums scrawled into the page corner. Jo couldn't 
understand a word of it.
0.16 recurring people out of 10 suffer from this medical problem. Does 
that mean that 0.16 recurring percent of the population are made up of 
people capable of telekinesis?
There was a huge question mark scrawled over this section of the paper 
so the sentence itself was barely readable. Then underneath he 
scrawled the answer.
NO.
This comment was obviously added at a later date.
See medical records for evidence of supernatural influences. Doctors 
claim it is a genetic disease but data disproves their theories and backs 
up mine. Melinda claimed to hear a high pitched giggling that nobody 
else could, not uncommon with this situation.
At the bottom of the page Jo could just about make out the conclusion. 
There was not much space on the page left for it and the tiny writing 
was difficult to decipher.
Conclusion: Melinda Edwards was victim to telekinetic influences. She 
displays similar traits I have researched from other records. The woman 
who murdered her was the second to be given the chemical but it was a 
strong overdose and her own powers killed her from the inside out as 
they did to Edwards. 
It seemed that the more Jo read the less she understood. What 
chemical? Powers? None of it made any sense. She felt rather 
concerned about her father's mental health by this point. 
	Jo turned the paper over checking to see if anything useful was 
written on the back. There was. It was one of her father's to do lists he 
always wrote when he was panicking about something.
Cally - Keep a close eye on her after that leak.
Check chemicals for contamination.
Make sure Jo hasn't been infected.
This time Jo had a better idea of what was going on. Some time ago, 
after her parents had split up her father spent more and more time in 
the study. One day Jo was in the middle of doing her homework and she 
heard violent coughing from the room. Cally had insisted that they go 
and check it out.  So her sister had led the way. Together the girls had 
stood outside the door cautious of whether they should or shouldn't 
enter but then their father rushed out from the room spluttering. His 
clothes were covered in grey smoke and more of the substance wafted 
out of the air. He was wearing a helmet much to their surprise. The 
substance wafted right into Cally's face. John had warned them both to 
get back and closed the door behind him. Whenever the girls referred to 
that incident he said it was just a minor leak, of what they had no clue, 
but he always looked at Cally in concern when the leak was mentioned. 
       Now Jo understood a lot more of that. The chemicals he talked 
about constantly in his notes were the fluorescent liquids in the test 
tubes and judging from the helmet he had been wearing at the time and 
the gear on the coat hanger that Jo had seen when she investigated her 
father's study, there was high risk involved with handling them. 
Somehow these chemicals were related to the supernatural powers her 
father mentioned. Telekinesis; surely he had to be joking!? But then 
again if the substance that Cally had got a face full of that day was the 
result of a chemical experiment gone wrong did that mean that she too 
had these powers? Jo thought back carefully. Had her sister ever shown 
evidence of being able to move or control things with her mind? 
"Yes." she gasped. "I don't believe I am genuinely considering this!"
Jo felt crazy for thinking it but the time that light bulb had leaked 
supposedly oil in their bedroom Cally had been angry. Really angry. But 
when John came in she'd been distracted and the leak had stopped. 
She'd been exhausted afterwards. The only decent excuse for this was 
that the disturbing leak had been a drain on her powers. Then there was 
today with Mrs Richardson. The teacher had been yelling at her before 
she started hearing voices and the leaking projector fell down. Yet that 
was by far a drastic change in Cally's powers when compared to the 
meagre light bulb incident. Something must've boosted her power. But 
what?
	Then Jo started to consider the disturbing options. What if 
Cally's boosted powers could kill? What if Cally had killed Diane that 
fateful weekend? What if Cally had killed Mr Porter, that friendly 
substitute teacher whose remains were found in a ditch a while back? 
He had always got on Cally's nerves but personally Jo had liked him. She 
felt a shiver of fear weave its way through her body. Could her sister 
have done all of this? Jo knew it was all very well to speculate, but she 
had to know what was boosting her sister's powers (if she had them, 
but by now Jo had herself convinced) if she wanted to know the facts. 
***
Dolph leered over his girlfriend. As he'd thought, she was totally 
helpless. 
"D-Dolph I feel - h-help me!" she squeaked. 
He could do whatever he wanted. Then the doorbell rang, interrupting 
his thoughts and actions.
"Back in a sec Cal. Don't you move a muscle."
"I - I don't think I can!"
I should hope so too, Dolph thought to himself. It had taken a lot of 
bargaining and unreasonable promises to get that kind of drug off Roy. 
Although he was rather impressed by the pain factor, that something 
supernatural about his girlfriend made things like these ten times 
worse. He crept over to the stairs and watched Aileen answer it. 
Unfortunately his fears were correct: the policewoman from earlier 
stood on the doorstep.
"I suppose you have more questions to ask my daughter?" huffed 
Aileen.
"Actually I was here to inform you that her boyfriend has been doing 
drugs but that sounds like a good idea too." Linda agreed.
"WHAT!?" Aileen screeched. She'd been on the verge of an explosion 
ever since her near shouting match with Cally. "I BET HE WAS THE ONE 
WHO TURNED HER ONTO THEM!"
"Excuse me?"
"I GOT A CALL FROM THE DOCTOR TODAY SAYING THAT TEST RESULTS 
SHOWED CALLY HAD BEEN TAKING COCAINE!"
At this Linda frowned.
"In that case do you mind if I search her bedroom."
"I ALREADY DID! FOUND A PACKET OF THE STUFF!" 
"Well, my search methods may be more thorough."
Aileen seemed to deflate a little at this news and nodded. Dolph rushed 
over to the bathroom door and locked it. Hopefully that would convince 
both the policewoman and Aileen that Cally was on the loo instead of 
being hidden in her own bedroom by her runaway boyfriend. He ran 
back inside the bedroom with barely any time on his hands. The 
policewoman was in the house. He groaned. So much for the perfect 
opportunity to get into Cally's pants at long last! What a waste. He 
sighed and loomed over her once more.
"Can you move Cal?"
"N-no." He couldn't be bothered to fake concern. He picked her up and 
simply slung her over his shoulder. She let out a scream at this. "It - it 
hurts."
Startled by her yell, he dropped her. She screamed louder. Both the 
policewoman and Aileen ran upstairs. Dolph could hear their hurried 
footsteps on the staircase outside the bedroom.
"Damn!" he swore. He knelt down beside his girlfriend. "Cal I need you 
to be quite for me yeah? It'll be over soon."
"O-okay."
Despite everything Cally still trusted him. It wasn't his fault he was 
clumsy. She knew she loved Dolph and that was all she needed. Cally 
found it difficult to form words as the paralysis took over but she could 
still yell or make guttural noises if she tried hard enough. Realising this 
Dolph ran to the laundry basket in the corner of the room and opened 
it. He took out the top layer of smelly clothing and dumped Cally in 
below it. Then he piled the rest of the laundry on top of her to hide the 
girl sufficiently and muffle her cries. She gagged slightly. 
"Don't move!" he hissed and forcefully closed the lid.
Dolph ran over to the windows sill, jumped up onto the ledge and pulled 
the curtains in front of him. He was just in the nick of time. 
	Aileen brutally wrenched open the door. From the noise it made 
Dolph felt a little sorry for it.
"CALLY? Are you okay?"
Dolph closed his eyes and prayed that Cally would do as he had told her 
to. Much to his relief she said nothing. Or at least if she did maybe his 
muffling technique had worked effectively. The policewoman scanned 
the room. 
"She's not in here."
"But I heard her scream -"
"I heard her too. Maybe she's in the bathroom?"
Aileen sighed in relief at this option.
"Yes, new spots never fail to annoy her. That has to be it." She nipped 
into the corridor and tried the door handle to the bathroom. The door 
was locked. "Cally are you okay in there?" No reply. Aileen relaxed 
visibly. "Okay well I'll leave you to your sulking." With that she re-joined 
Linda who had already begun to search the room. Dolph held his breath 
as he heard the clattering of the policewoman moving about objects in 
the room. She opened the laundry basket and delved into it slightly but 
did not dig far enough to find Cally fortunately for Dolph. Now he could 
hear her coming in his direction as she checked different items and 
pieces of furniture. She was virtually right next to him! Her hand stroked 
the side of the curtains much to Dolph's dismay. "I still have the packet 
if you want to look at it." commented Aileen.
Linda turned.
"Yes that would be useful."
"It's just downstairs." Together the pair left the room but Dolph waited 
for at least ten minutes until emerging from his hiding place. He crept 
out to the staircase once more and listened in on the conversation. 
"Will you need to do anymore searching?"
"No, this packet is more useful than you realise. How long will Cally be?"
"A good few hours when it comes down to moping."
"Too long to stick around for then. I will come by tomorrow morning for 
questioning. Thank you for your help."
Dolph waited until he heard the front door close and then returned to 
the room. He opened the laundry basket and started to chuck Cally's 
dirty clothes around her room. He knew Aileen would just assume she'd 
had another one of her temper tantrums and wouldn't question the 
extra messiness at all. Finally he got to his girlfriend. Her body lay limply 
amongst the clothing. Her legs and arms rubbed against the rough 
edges of the basket leaving sore red marks on her skin. Cally was barely 
conscious. Her eyelids opened and closed slowly as if she were in a 
daze. He knew she probably was.
"D-dol-ph-" she muttered.
"I'm here. Sorry about that."
"S-s'okay."
He grabbed her by the arms and lifted her out of the basket, more 
gently for fear of her screams raising the alarm for a second time. He 
could tell from the expression on her face that the movement still hurt a 
lot. Cally felt as if her joints were slowly rusting. He hooked her up into a 
position you often saw in movies where her back and legs rested on his 
arms and her own arm was dangling over his shoulder. It was less 
dramatic than it was in the films considering the fact that Dolph was 
barely strong enough to carry his semi-conscious girlfriend. He took a 
few steps towards the bed, tripped and fell onto the covers. At least 
they both got a soft landing. Dolph glanced nervously at Cally. Her eyes 
were closed and she was breathing heavily. It looked like the drug had 
finally knocked her out. He wished it hadn't taken so long but smirked 
all the same.
"Now, where were we?"

Rory was having a day off unsurprisingly. Linda had a feeling that when 
he got back he'd milk the guilt out of her for all he was worth but for the 
moment she envied him. It was Diane's funeral today. The last time 
Linda had seen the girl's mother she'd looked pretty upset along with 
her husband. She didn't want to intrude on the ceremony but it was the 
only way she'd be able to interview the parents properly about their 
daughter. She would have done another house visit but when she came 
last time she had barely been able to step inside due to fear. This couple 
had a pet snake. Snakes had always terrified Linda, ever since she was a 
little girl and caught a viewing of Snakes On a Plane on the television by 
accident. The way they slithered about the place, the sheen of their 
scales - everything about them petrified her. She knew that she was 
head of the police department and could get someone else to do it for 
her, but she wanted to get this done herself. 
	The last time she had seen Mr and Mrs Metters she'd only been 
able to tell them the bad news. She also managed to stutter a little 
reassurance saying that they would find who murdered Diane and 
would bring him or her to justice. It had sounded like a line out of a 
cheesy movie and rather unconvincing to say the least. Linda sighed and 
hoped that not too many reporters had had the same idea as her. Since 
she was going for a more discreet look she was dressed in her casual 
clothing instead of uniform and took her regular car to the church. Linda 
hoped that they wouldn't recognise her, or at least that if they did they 
would assume it was just because she was a friend of Diane's. She didn't 
want to alarm the distressed couple further. Surely they'd been through 
enough by now. Part of Linda knew exactly how they felt. She wouldn't 
interrogate them directly, she'd just engage with polite, curious 
conversation. If they asked her who she was she would tell them the 
truth. It was as simple as that. She didn't want to give the parents any 
more reason to avoid her.
	These thoughts whirled about her head like violent gusts of 
wind as she sat on the pews. She was painfully aware that Mr and Mrs 
Metters were on the row just behind her, sobbing their eyes out along 
with many others as Jo Sanders read out a poem about her friend. She'd 
written it herself for the occasion. She stood at the front nervously.
"I-I'm not very good with words so I'm sorry if it comes out a bit 
blabbery." she told her audience. Then she started to recite the rhymes 
she'd spent ages meticulously writing out.
"I met you through my sister,
Now I can't help but miss ya.
Please give me a sign.
I keep hoping you're alive.
Now we're all struggling 
I feel like I'm juggling
All these thoughts round and round and round in my head.
So from me,
And everybody here
Goodbye Diane
It's a shame your game plan 
Didn't work out."
Jo stepped down, the tears streaming across her face. The audience 
applauded and her father gave her a big hug. He had work he should be 
doing but he was due a day off and his daughters needed him; today 
more than ever. John made a brief scan of the church. Where was Cally? 
He knew Aileen would have work but it was unlike his daughter to not 
show. 
	Linda applauded along with everyone else at Jo's performance. 
It had been very sweet; she hadn't realised that Jo had known Diane 
that well. She had assumed that Cally was the best friend. Now Linda 
found herself re-thinking that view. Where was Jo's sister anyways? 
       Diane's coffin was lifted up and two men carried it down the 
aisle. Linda started to blend into the crowd as everyone stood up and 
filed after them. It was easy; she simply had to mill about along with 
everyone else. They were slowly exiting the church building so they 
could stand by and watch the coffin being buried. This was her 
opportunity to talk to the parents. She ensured that she kept close to 
them as the mob swarmed about the church at a sluggish pace. Linda 
stepped after them through the ornate doors covered in intricate, yet 
religious patterning. The mark of Jesus' sacrifice was repeated a million 
times on its surface, idolised in a golden print. As the crowd shuffled 
into the church graveyard Linda found herself stretching her neck to 
look back at the door but it was too late now. That wasn't what she was 
there for anyways. The group of people slowly gathered around a pre-
dug grave. The coffin bearers lowered Diane into the ground whilst 
everybody remained respectfully silent. There were a lot of people at 
the ceremony which only made it more upsetting; Diane had had a lot 
of friends. 
       There was a crunch as the coffin hit the bottom of the grave and 
people started to file away. Most of them stopped to say how sorry they 
were to the parents about their daughter but many simply walked off to 
leave the pair in peace. There was a long queue stretching out in front 
of Mr and Mrs Metters. Linda decided to stick around until it had 
shortened and wiped away the tears. She always cried at funerals, it 
didn't matter whether she knew the victim or not. Besides, nobody this 
young deserved to die so early.
       ***
Cally slept strangely that night. She dreamt about the most bizarre 
situations. As she snored the dreams were already well under way. In 
the first part of it she ate dinner with a walnut and a surprisingly large 
squirrel. The walnut seemed disturbingly suicidal and was insisting that 
Cally should eat it, but she was disgusted by the very thought of eating 
her new friend. The squirrel was backing up the walnut unsurprisingly. 
Then it changed scene and continued to flit between different ones for 
the rest of her time sleeping. But, constantly throughout each scenario, 
there was a girl called Heather who seemed to be warning her about 
something and telling her what to do, although Cally couldn't work out 
what. The blonde sounded like she was speaking French, so it was 
difficult to tell what she was saying. All Cally could work out was that 
whatever the girl was telling her she was being bossy about it. Then 
there was something rather weird about an ancient cheese grater but it 
dissolved into a dirty liquid that seemed to consume her lungs. This 
woke Cally up with a start, as she felt like she was choking.
        When Cally sat up she put her hand on her forehead instantly. 
She felt hung over. She glanced at the clock and found she'd slept in by 
a good few hours. It was too late to think of a decent excuse for why she 
was late for school. She could tell from the silence of the house that her 
mother had already left for work. She had a splitting headache and 
could remember little of what happened the previous night other than 
Dolph staying over, although thought of her boyfriend filled her with 
glee.
"Good morning sleepy head." greeted Dolph.
He was perched on the end of her bed.
"Why didn't you wake me up?" she questioned angrily.
Dolph attempted to hide his frown. He had. Repeatedly. But she refused 
to even open her eyes. The stuff he'd given her last night must've have 
been stronger than he'd thought. So much for his food fight plan, it 
would have to wait for another day. On the bright side at least he'd got 
what he wanted last night.
"You looked so peaceful, besides I think we're due a skive."
She sighed.
"You're right." Cally smiled. "As always."
She glanced at the clock again and gasped.
"What is it this time?" he moaned.
"I'm half an hour late for Diane's funeral! It'll be over soon!"
"Well come on then!" 
He held out a tray of cooked breakfast before her.
"Dolph did you do this?"
"Well duh."
"For me?"
"Well, I did it for myself first."
She giggled.
"Thanks. But I don't have time to eat much."
She took the tray from him and gulped down the bacon at a record rate. 
"You should eat more than that." Dolph insisted. 
He needed her strong if he wanted her to be sufficiently ready for the 
food fight tomorrow.  She waffled down the baked beans before getting 
out of bed.
"I'm going to get changed now. Don't look."
"Seriously? Cally you're my girlfriend for crying out loud!"
"Fine I'll get changed in the bathroom." she huffed.
She grabbed some clothes from the wardrobe and left before Dolph 
could protest. After a few minutes she returned.
"Let's go."
As soon as Cally got out of the door she started to run. It was difficult 
for Dolph to keep up with her.
"Why so speedy?" he asked.
"I'M OVER HALF AN HOUR LATE DOLPH WHY DO YOU THINK?" she 
bellowed.
He held up his hands in a defensive gesture.
"Okay! Don't take it out on me."
"You were supposed to wake me up!" she grumbled and sped up.
Dolph started to sprint in order to talk to his girlfriend.
"Can - we - slow - down?" he panted.
"No. I thought you were good at sports!" she complained.
"Not - running."
"Evidently." Cally agreed.
"Isn't - the church - really - close to your house - anyways?"
"That's my dad's house."
"Oh."
From then on Dolph didn't say much. He just tried to keep up the pace 
he was going at. They got a few odd looks as they raced towards the 
other side of town but the pair finally made it to the church graveyard. 
It was next to empty. Only three people remained on the grounds. 
Diane's parents and a woman who looked familiar but Cally couldn't 
work out where she'd seen her before. Diane did have a rather 
extensive network of friends. Cally hurtled towards the grave where the 
remaining people stood. Sure enough, it was Diane's grave stone. It had 
her name on it and the year she was born in and died in as traditional 
but there was a quote that made her smile. It was just so - Di.
"For some moments in life there are no words."
It was a quote from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. 	Diana 
and Cally been in a particularly boring ICT lesson which consisted of 
spread sheets. So they'd looked up gravestone quotes when they got 
tired of the class work. This had been one of them.
       The parents came over to her.
"Cally can you thank your sister for us, the poem she read out was very 
- good." said Mrs Metters. 
Tears still streaked down her face and her voice was a little wobbly but 
it was easy enough to understand her words. It looked like Cally had 
missed the entire ceremony.  Yet, although she wished it had been her 
reading the poem instead of her sister, she found that she couldn't 
summon any anger. Dolph was surprised about this but Cally wasn't. 
She was too busy being upset about the fact that her dead friend lay 
barely centimetres away from her underground. She sat down in front 
of the grave and Dolph joined her. He was rather alarmed and unsure of 
what to do when she started to cry, her body shaking. He reached out 
nervously and put his arm around her. Her sobs did not lessen but she 
hadn't hit him which was good. He shook his head. Cally just didn't 
make any sense, but then again the drugs probably didn't help.
	Linda turned to the parents. Now was the time to seize the 
opportunity. She felt like a traitor, but work was work.
"I'm so sorry for your loss. It must've been so unexpected."
Mrs Metters nodded slightly but was too busy crying to reply. Instead 
her husband replied.
"Not really."
"What do you mean?"
"You know what society is like these days. The police could do a better 
job."
Chapter 6
He narrowed his eyes as he mentioned the p-word. Linda could feel him 
seeing right through her disguise and repressed a shiver.
"Honey stop it. They're doing their best." argued Mrs Metters who had 
managed to stop crying enough to retort. "It was the head of the police 
department who came to see us remember?"
"Doesn't mean she'll do any better than an average officer."
Linda was getting increasingly more uncomfortable and tried to shift the 
topic of conversation without sounding completely tactless.
"Where were you when you found out the news?"
"I was home when the policewoman came round to our house. It was 
my day off." Mrs Metters whimpered.
"I was at work. I was barely a few blocks away can you believe it? I 
could've stopped it." 
"There was nothing you could've done." Linda reassured.
"We could've stopped her going to those parties! You even knew what 
she was up to didn't you!" he exclaimed turning on his wife. She simply 
sobbed. "TELL HER WHAT YOU TOLD ME YESTERDAY!"
Linda stepped inbetween the pair. This was getting out of hand.
"I don't want to know." she said firmly.
Mr Metters ignored her.
"GO ON, REMIND ME!" he yelled.
"No." whispered his wife. "I - I don't want you ordering me about."
At this announcement Mr Metters started to stride towards her. Linda 
found herself stuck in the middle of his path. Now she had to quit 
pretending.
"Sir please step away."
"MAKE ME!"
"If you don't step away I will make you."
He snorted. Linda kicked him in the groin and he let out a moan of pain 
as he fell to his knees. Linda gestured to his shocked wife. The woman 
promptly moved a little further out of harm's way. She was trembling.
"I'm sorry, he's upset. He always gets like this when he's upset."
"Just how many times has he tried that?" asked Linda in an appalled 
tone.
From her silence she gathered more than once. That was when Mr 
Metters grabbed her legs and pulled. Linda fell backwards. As her head 
hit the ground she saw stars. But then the beautiful night sky was 
interrupted by Mr Metters' head as he loomed over her. 
"Mind your own business." he hissed. "GAYLE TELL HER!"
	Cally tensed in Dolph's arms at the yelling going on behind her. 
How dare they shout in a graveyard! They were disrespecting all the 
people at rest on the grounds! But most importantly, they were 
disrespecting Diane. Cally turned and Dolph quickly let go of her. She 
stared at the scene. Linda was on the floor and slowly getting to her 
feet; Mr Metters was marching towards his wife and she looked 
terrified. Cally felt her anger concentrate into a small white spot. It was 
focussed on Diane's father. Cally smiled. After that time with Mrs 
Richardson she understood a little more about what she was doing. This 
time round she knew how to aim.
       Mr Metters was only a few paces away from Gayle when he 
collapsed. He writhed on the ground. Sensibly his wife kept her 
distance. Linda ran over to him. A disgusting, oily liquid oozed from his 
gaping mouth. She grabbed her phone and called an ambulance. On 
hanging up she glanced at Gayle.
"You can come closer if you want, whatever this is he's not faking."
She shook her head. Then her eyes widened in recognition.
"You're that policewoman aren't you?" she asked in a tiny voice.
"Yes. I'm sorry I had to interrogate you that way."
"I-I'm glad you were here." she squeaked.
Linda remembered Cally and glanced behind her. She was standing in a 
venomous pose. But suddenly she looked frail and weak. More 
importantly Dolph was by her side. He was gazing at her in awe. 
"Hey!" she called. 
They ran. Linda groaned. She should've brought more people with her 
so she had backup on the scene. She reached for her phone again to call 
for more police to chase after the kids but they'd probably be too late to 
catch them. Linda knew that she couldn't leave Gayle alone with her 
husband. Although he looked in no state to hurt her there was no saying 
how long he would stay like that for. Mrs Metters came over and sat by 
her husband's side. 
"I- I told him that she was our daughter and if she was going to go to 
these parties we should trust her to look after herself. She came back 
late every weekend but she was cautious enough to have a good time 
without going over the top." she said. "I know it's pathetic that I let him 
push me around like that but I can't leave him because then he'll be 
alone with Diane."
Linda sensed that Gayle had been bottling this up inside herself for a 
long time. The words seemed to rush out of her mouth, impatient at the 
long wait to be spoken.
"Diane is dead now. You don't owe her that protection anymore." As 
Linda said this she looked down upon the still Mr Metters. A pool of the 
horrible oily substance was gathering underneath his chin as the 
remains dripped from his mouth. It was no longer a steady flow of the 
vile stuff. Funny how it had stopped as soon as Dolph and Cally had left, 
Linda had a strange feeling that the liquid was something to do with 
Cally. She'd looked so powerful, and then so fragile. Anyways, if Mr 
Metters survived to tell the tale, he was a new suspect. He seemed 
upset enough about his daughter, but if he treated his wife that way 
then who was to say he didn't do the same to Diane? "Gayle, has your 
husband ever hurt you?"
"No, Charles just got angry. I think he may have gotten close to it a few 
times but all he did was scare me." She looked down at her husband 
wistfully. "This is the most he has ever scared me."
Linda sighed. At least that was something, if the woman was telling the 
truth.
"How did he act towards Diane?"
"They had a rather off and on relationship." Gayle replied cautiously. 
"Sometimes they'd argue and sometimes they'd enjoy themselves. One 
minute they'd be laughing the next they'd be shouting over a silly little 
thing like misunderstandings over homework."
	The sound of multiple sirens cut through her trail of thought. 
The ambulance was there and so were the police. Or rather, Mark. The 
paramedics rushed out from the white vehicle to see to Charles and 
Linda stood to meet her backup.
"So what do you need me down here for?" he asked.
"Before this man collapsed I saw Dolph standing by his girlfriend." Linda 
informed him.
"He's the teenage druggie who assaulted Rory, right?"
"Yes."
"Why didn't you chase after him?"
Linda gritted her teeth.
"Because I couldn't leave Gayle alone and you didn't turn up fast 
enough."
"He's her husband for Christ's sake! Surely she could have kept an eye 
on him fine by herself!" Mark exclaimed.
"He scares her. Look, Dolph went that way," Linda pointed in the 
direction the couple had fled in. "you take that route I'll take this one; 
we'll stay in contact via phone."
"Fine."
"Good."
They set off at a run on their individuals routes. 
       After a few minutes of this with no sight of Dolph or Cally Linda 
felt her phone vibrate in her pocket.  She picked it up and answered the 
call.
"Hello?"
"Any luck yet?"
It was Mark.
"No, you?"
"Nope."
"Then why are you calling me?"
"It's boring running down the streets on your own. People give you 
funny looks. I just want to chat."
"Well we've had a chat so why don't you just get back to it?"
"I can run and talk at the same time surprisingly enough." 
Linda groaned. Mark smiled.
"What do you want?" she asked.
"I want to talk about Rory."
"Ok-ay." He was after something. Whether it was information or just a 
glare Linda had no idea. She had a feeling he would have both by the 
end of their conversation and was beginning to wish she hadn't called 
for backup in the first place. Mark was quiet for a while. "You still 
there?"
"Yeah, thinking." Linda snorted. "Do you like Rory?"
"Of course I like him otherwise we wouldn't be working on so much of 
this case together!" she replied.
"Uh huh."
"It's really difficult to work with someone you hate."
"So you hate him then?"
"What? I never said that."
"You act different around him you know."
"Really?" Linda deadpanned.
She was completely unconvinced.
"Linda I'm not the only person who's spotted it."
"Don't call me Linda!" she snapped.
"See? You let him call you by your first name. That has to mean 
something."
She struggled to find an argument for that. 
"Maybe I'm just forgetful when I'm with him." she retorted.
When Mark next spoke she could hear the smugness coming at her in 
waves.
"Sure you are." His voice was practically dripping with sarcasm. "Answer 
this question, honestly. Do you like like him?"
"What on Earth are you talking about?"
"You know what I mean."
"How old are you?!" Linda exclaimed finally getting his meaning. Mark's 
phrasing made him sound like a school child. "Our relationship is strictly 
professional."
"Oh come on at least think about it."
At this point Linda hung up only to receive another phone call barely a 
few seconds afterwards. It was Mark, again. She sighed and answered 
for the second time. She had a feeling she was going to regret it.
"What now?"
"I've found them."
***
John Sanders sighed. Jo had at long last remembered to tell him about 
Dolph's drug addiction. To be honest he wasn't terribly surprised. From 
what Cally had told him about Dolph (she did tend to go on about the 
boy a lot before they finally got together) his bad boy reputation was 
part of what made him so attractive. He just hoped that it wasn't 
affecting Cally. Next time he saw her they needed to have a serious talk. 
Whether it was about anger, drugs or grief something needed to be 
said. He knew from experience that although Aileen may care, she just 
couldn't find the right words for these matters. John was both surprised 
and confused by Cally's absence at the funeral. But again, he couldn't do 
anything about it unless he saw her.
	He sighed as he entered the study. Jo was back at school and 
most likely still in tears after the depressing start to the day. He hoped 
that her friends would be able to cheer her up. It was just as well that 
she wasn't in the house; she'd be far safer that way. John opened the 
creaky door and put on his helmet and goggles for safety. Today he was 
going to do a very important experiment. If it succeeded it would 
provide vital information for his boss and his family, although the latter 
wouldn't realise it. He put on a pair of rubber gloves. It was exceedingly 
important that he did not let one drop of the filthy Haemohydro 
chemical touch his hand. The substance was contained by a test tube, in 
a separate cupboard of its own for health and safety reasons. 
       When John opened the door to the cupboard he could barely 
see the chemical because its black colouring blended in so well with the 
darkness surrounding it. He turned the light on in the study and reached 
out for the liquid. His sweaty fingers closed around the test tube and he 
removed it from the cupboard. He was nervous but it was only to be 
expected. If he couldn't even cook there was a pretty good chance that 
a simple experiment, such as this one, would go wrong. John's hand 
shook as he held the test tube above his desk. He brushed the scrap 
paper off of it to make space for the Haemohydro and picked up a 
diagram he had made earlier. He glanced at it. This was too important 
for words, everything had to go perfectly. 
       John leant over to grab the test tube on the other side of the 
desk. It contained a luminous liquid. He had nicknamed the fluorescent 
blue chemical 'Frost'. It wasn't hard to guess why. The substance was 
freezing cold, even at room temperature. It made little sense, but that 
wasn't unusual in his job. John was used to it by now. 
       He grabbed a beaker from his equipment drawer and poured 
the contents of the blackened test tube into it. It slowly dripped out 
from its containment. The Haemohydro had grown rather gloopy over 
time; John dreaded to think what would happen when it started to rot 
inside Cally. Then it had the potential to block up god knows what. On 
the bright side at least it wasn't corrosive. Well it was a little, but it 
wasn't a threat to his daughter just yet. He tipped the Frost into the 
beaker. It poured out much faster than the Haemohydro. The fluid 
trickled into the beaker almost as soon as John tilted it, yet he knew one 
touch could give him frostbite. His boss had sent it to him along with the 
other chemicals in a rather securely sealed box. The man knew that 
John was doing the experiment of course; he could only go ahead with it 
if he had sufficient permission.
       And then all there was left to do was watch. So John watched. 
He'd gotten through the main stage of the experiment without 
contaminating himself or anything but the beaker. That was pretty 
good. He took the test tubes and went to wash them in the kitchen 
whilst the concoction did its business. John knew from countless 
experience these mixtures took a little time to sort themselves out. He'd 
tried so many different combinations since Cally had been 
contaminated. This was the most dangerous by far, if he had 
mishandled either substance it would've been the end for him. But he 
hadn't. John let out a deep sigh, he could breathe freely now.
        He dried the equipment and brought the two test tubes back 
up to the study. He dumped them in the drawer amongst the rest of the 
chaos in there. John made a mental note to clean up that drawer at 
some point. Then he returned to the mixture on the table. The 
concoction had formed into layers. The top layer of the Haemohydro 
was frozen. The icy blue sheen that surrounded it was rather pretty due 
to its reflective surface. John sighed. It didn't look like it had worked.
"There goes another possible cure out the window." he murmured. 
He reached out for the beaker but was startled by a strange cracking 
sound that came from the Haemofrost compound. The Frost seemed to 
be working its way through the Haemohydro towards the bottom of it. 
John gasped as the pressure of the Frost made the Haemohydro below 
give way. The substance crumbled into tiny pieces with a loud groan yet 
the beaker remained intact. John grinned; he'd been working on this for 
so long. At long last he could finally save Cally from her impending 
doom! Just in the nick of time too, her symptoms had been getting 
worse the last time he'd seen her. John now knew that he could crack 
the Haemohydro inside her without even hurting her body with any 
luck. But how to give it to her? If the Frost was added separately he'd 
give her throat frostbite. He had to add the chemicals together. He 
could do it tonight. That was when he'd next see her anyways. She'd be 
just in time for dinner.
***
Dolph was running. He'd never run so fast in his life, it was a shame that 
his girlfriend couldn't keep up. A policeman had spotted them barely 
minutes ago and had given chase. They had to lose him. Dolph didn't 
care how, they just had to. Cally, however, was slowing him down.
"Come on Cal!"
Ever since she used her powers on Charles Metters she'd seemed a bit 
out of it. Then again, she was always like this after using them.
"I-I can't!" she gasped.
Cally took a few steps, then tottered into the pile of dustbin bags piled 
up on the street beside them. At least it was a soft landing. Dolph 
groaned. He was really getting tired of her constant collapsing. It was 
irritating. But the boost that strong drugs gave her powers always 
seemed to make her even more exhausted after using them. Dolph 
glanced behind him. He could hear Mark coming around the corner. He 
looked back at Cally. Maybe her collapsing wasn't such a bad thing after 
all. He dived into the pile of dustbin bags outside the bins and pushed 
her underneath with him. He put his hand over her mouth, he doubted 
she'd make any noise but there was no harm in being cautious. Dolph 
peered through the gaps inbetween the dustbin bags and wrinkled his 
nose. The smell was disgusting. He had a nasty feeling that he was going 
to stink of it afterwards. He watched Mark rush past. The policeman was 
talking into his phone.
"I think I've lost them. Yes I know, well what do you suggest?" he 
snapped.
His voice faded into the distance and Dolph began to climb out from the 
pungent pile of rubbish, dragging Cally with him.
"Dolph?" she muttered.
"What?"
"I need to tell you something."
"Okay." Dolph let go of her shoulders and she slid onto the ground in a 
sitting position. He sat down beside her. "Shoot."
"I - I think I've got these powers. It's almost like telekinesis - I can make 
horrible things happen to, well; anyone or anything I want."
He rolled his eyes. Had it really only just occurred to her?
"I know."
"You what?"
He wanted to tell her that it was blindingly obvious but decided to opt 
for the more romantic response. Or at least, it was romantic in Cally's 
eyes.
"I know you better than you do."
"I guess."
"Doesn't it feel good?"
"Pardon?"
"Never mind."
"No, what did you say?"
"Does it really matter?"
"Fine."
Cally got to her feet. Dolph sensed that she was a little annoyed with 
him, he had to change that. If she'd finally realised that she could do 
whatever she wanted to whoever she wanted he didn't want to be in 
her bad books.
"I'm sorry Cal; I just don't like seeing you like this."
Her face still looked stormy but Dolph could tell that she was hiding a 
smile at his concern.
"Let's go back home. Mum won't get back from work for hours." Dolph 
nodded with a smirk, mission accomplished. They started to walk back 
in the direction they had come in. "Why was that policeman chasing 
after us anyways?" Dolph frowned. He knew he had to be careful the 
way he said this. "Dolph have you been stealing again?"
The way Cally said it made her almost sound like she was squealing in 
delight. Dolph knew for a fact that his bad boy behaviour turned her on 
to a certain extent. He decided that he might as well play up to his 
reputation.
"It was just a little thing."
"Go on, tell me."
"No."
"Why not?"
"It'll spoil the surprise."
"Is it for me?"
Dolph sighed. Now he was going to have to steal her something to cover 
up the lie he was about to create.
"Maybe, maybe not. You're not going to see it until tomorrow."
Cally pouted. 
"Oh come on Dolph!"
"No."
They continued to walk into the distance but Cally was tiring fast. She 
seemed dead on her feet much to Dolph's annoyance but it was for this 
reason that she was letting slip a little more information than intended.
"I'm meant to be staying at my dad's tonight. Do you want to come?"
"Course I do." Dolph lied. He'd had enough time with his girlfriend for 
one day, but it wasn't like he had anywhere else to go. "But you can't 
tell your dad I'm staying over."
"Why not?"
"Just trust me."
"Your eyes are pretty."
"What?"
"Nothing."
They continued walking for a bit in silence.
"How far away is your mum's house?"
"My dad's house is closer. I'll text mum to say I'm going straight to his or 
something." Cally brought out her phone and did so. They kept walking. 
"Dolph I need to tell you something else as well," she began.
"What now?"
He wondered if she'd had another stupidly obvious revelation such as 
realising her mood swings were ridiculous half the time.
"I think I love you."
"You think?" he asked in horror.
"Well I don't know, I've never been in love before. Is this what it feels 
like?"
Dolph felt the urge to back away from her desperately. He forced 
himself to stay close. If she loved him, then she wouldn't turn on him 
with her powers.
"Yes."
"So..." she trailed off, but when she spoke again her words came out so 
fast they were difficult to make out. "do you love me back?"
Dolph hesitated, this was one huge lie he was about to pull off. He 
wasn't sure whether he was up to the challenge or not. 
"Sure."
That was a good response. That could go either way. It could stand for 
sure I do, or sure I don't. Dolph definitely knew what it stood for in this 
case but Cally didn't seem to get the gist. This confirming one word 
answer was enough for her.
"Really?"
"Sure."
She put one hand on his cheek and leant over to kiss him. Dolph knew 
that this was it; he'd have to start seeing new people soon. After all, all 
work and no play make Dolph a dull boy.
***
Jo was upset and stuck at school. She couldn't help wondering where 
her sister was. She knew that there was a good chance Cally was 
bunking for today. At least she was smart enough not to weep her eyes 
out at school but Jo had at least expected to see her at Diane's funeral. 
Cally had known Diane since primary school for god's sake! On the 
bright side, the anti-biotic the nurse had given Jo the other day seemed 
to have done its job well and her friends were constantly finding new 
ways to make her laugh. It was just as well, the depression of Diane's 
death had really come crashing down around her after that funeral. It 
was only now that the events truly hit home and Jo still felt like she was 
in shock from it all. A few days was not enough to get over someone 
being completely gone from your life and today's ceremony did nothing 
but enhance that fact. Although her friends did their best to comfort her 
part of Jo wished that her father was at the school. She wanted him to 
give her one of his big bear hugs and swear to her everything was going 
to be alright. No such luck. Jo felt hollow inside. It was rather awkward 
when Yasmine tried to strike up a conversation.
"Did you hear about what Josh did to -"
"Yes." Jo deadpanned.
"Oh. Okay, well did you hear about -"
"What Katie did next?"
A few of the friends surrounding her smiled at the unintentional pun.
"Okay. Maybe you've heard that one too." Yasmine allowed.
"Do you know where Cally is?"
"How should I know? She's your sister."
Jo remained silent at that news. She and Cally didn't exactly have the 
best sisterly relationship in the world. Yasmine gave up at her attempt 
to make Jo grin and stepped back to let one of her other friends give it a 
go as they walked down the busy corridor. Zoe came forwards.
"I heard Cally was bunking with Dolph."
Zoe had given up on the joking around. She was very bad at that, so she 
decided to just talk about what Jo was asking for. It was the third lesson 
of the day and her friend was still looking upset. Maybe what she 
needed was a little information. Zoe was renowned amongst her friends 
for hearing the truth. When Yasmine entered a crowd she tuned into 
the gossip, however Zoe managed to filter out the mean lies when she 
listened to a group of school kids and picked up on what actually 
happened. This required a lot more talent.
"I didn't hear anything about that!" muttered Yasmine quietly with a 
hint of jealousy in her voice.
"Bunking with Dolph!?" exclaimed Jo.
"Well he is her boyfriend. I know you don't like him and I sure as hell 
know I don't like him but can you really blame the guy for wanting to 
get a little quality time with Cally?" piped up Ettie.
Jo was mildly surprised by the way her friend stood up for him. Last year 
Dolph had bullied her. Despite Ettie's outspoken nature she had said 
nothing to her friends, but Zoe had picked up on it and when she 
pointed it out to Jo she told a teacher first thing. After that the bullying 
stopped pretty fast.
"No, you don't understand."
"Then help us to." added Ally.
Jo stopped walking abruptly and the others banged into her. She spun 
round. 
"Dolph's doing drugs." she whispered.
"What!?" her friends chorused.
Yasmine's eyes lit up at this news.
"Keep it down!  A policewoman visited my dad's house to tell us to call 
her if we got any news of him." Jo eyed Yasmine warily. "Yas you can't 
go spreading this around. Same goes for the rest of you. This is a secret 
now."
"But you hate Dolph just as much as we do, why not spread it round a 
little?" said Ettie.
Okay, maybe she wasn't standing up for him.
"Because I don't want to hear people whispering stupid stuff behind my 
back about Cally! As much as I hate it, what applies to Dolph applies to 
her as well in a stranger's eyes. The rumours could get nastier and 
spread to the rest of my family. Do you remember that incident with 
Eve?"
The group groaned in unison. Ally put her hand over her eyes.
"Don't remind me!"
Eve was a nasty example of how rumours could destroy a kid's life.
"Exactly."
"So is Cally not taking them?"
"Wha-" Jo began, she hadn't even considered it. 
They were told on a frequent basis at school that drugs, peer pressure 
and underage sex was bad. The occasional sessions they had about the 
issues always emphasized the consequences, Jo dreaded to think what 
would happen to her already broken family if Cally was already living it. 
But before they could discuss the matter any further a teacher ushered 
them to their class, irritated with the way the teens were dawdling in 
the corridor.
***
Cally was glad when they arrived back at her father's house but she was 
also slightly nervous. Sneaking her boyfriend into the house under her 
mother's nose was one thing, but with her father it was a completely 
different matter. She felt so much guiltier about doing it, but she did it 
nonetheless. She let herself in with the house key and scanned her 
surroundings to make sure the coast was clear. It was. Her father was 
probably upstairs in the study doing god knows what. Cally turned to 
Dolph.
"When I say go make a run for it as quietly as you can. Head upstairs to 
your left, I share a room with Jo but don't worry, we should be able to 
manage around that somehow."
"How exactly?" asked Dolph dubiously.
"We have a pretty big cupboard."
"What?"
But before he could protest Cally shoved him inside the house.
"Go." she whispered. Dolph started to run, but he wasn't as quiet as 
Cally had hoped. She ran upstairs so she was in front of him, ready to 
protect her boyfriend from her father if he emerged. Sure enough she 
could hear the door opening. John Sanders was leaving his small 
sanctuary. Dolph however still seemed oblivious to all of this. She 
opened the door to the airing cupboard and stuffed her boyfriend inside 
it. Dolph's eyes widened. For a minute he thought that she was turning 
against him and he struggled in panic. She gave him a worried look. 
"Dolph stop it! Dad's coming! Since when are you afraid of the dark?"
On hearing this Dolph backed into the cupboard quite happily. Anything 
was better than Cally using her powers on him. Now she was aware of 
them she seemed to know a little more about what she was doing. He 
watched nervously through the crack of the door as John Sanders came 
out from his study labelled with a large, rather tattered looking keep out 
sign.
"You're home early Cally." said her father looking rather startled.
"Well yeah."
"Is everything okay?"
Cally took a moment to think back over the day. Dolph seemed to take 
over her mind at this point. She'd told him she loved him, he'd said it 
back, sort of. Well, he'd definitely acknowledged it. Plus she'd told him 
about her newly discovered powers and he was supporting her all the 
way, so far. She dreaded to think what would've happened if she'd told 
her sister. Dolph was a far better choice.
"Everything is wonderful!"
"I didn't see you at the funeral today."
"Oh. Well, I was late. But I did get there."
"You just don't seem very upset."
"Do you want me to be?"
"No; of course not darling." John was puzzled but knew if he pursued 
the subject she'd only get angry. "Look, I have to tell you something."
"Shoot."
"A policewoman came to our house yesterday."
"What are you telling me this for?"
John sighed. He was going to have to be careful about how he said this. 
He knew how his daughter could be when she got angry. He was so 
close to putting a stop to it but this kind of news simply couldn't wait.
"Cally darling I'm only telling you because I'm concerned. I know you're 
not stupid, you know what you're doing."
"What is there to be concerned about dad?"
Cally was nervous now. Maybe he knew that Dolph was in the airing 
cupboard. Maybe the policewoman had told him some lies about her.
"Do you promise me you'll stay calm if I tell you?"
"Fine."
"Show me your fingers." Cally held up her hands to show her uncrossed 
fingers. Her father always did this when he made people promise things. 
He sighed. "She told us that Dolph was taking drugs."
Cally had prepared herself, but nothing could prepare her for that 
bombshell.
"SHE WHAT!?"
"You promised you'd stay calm!" exclaimed John with a hurt look on his 
face. 
"MY TOES WERE CROSSED!" Cally barked sarcastically. "WHAT DO YOU 
HAVE AGAINST DOLPH!? WHAT DOES EVERYONE HAVE AGAINST MY 
BOYFRIEND? WE ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER GET IT? I LOVE HIM AND 
NOW I KNOW HE LOVES ME!"
Cally felt her anger focussing on her father. Part of her had no regrets, 
the other half however pulled away from it.
"Cally listen to me, I'm not saying you shouldn't love him. I'm just saying 
maybe you should use that to help him quit. I've been asked to phone 
the police station if I even catch sight of him."
But she was no longer listening. Cally screamed as the two opposing 
forces inside of her competed like shoulder angels for and against her 
powers hurting her father. He sighed and closed his eyes. He knew what 
was coming. He'd just hoped that it wouldn't happen so soon. Cally's 
anger descended on her father and he fell to the floor as his eyes began 
to leak like Charles Metters' had. After a few minutes of watching him 
writhe Cally couldn't continue, she looked away from him and that 
seemed to break the connection. John lay still. He groaned slightly. Cally 
walked over to his side and towered over him.
"I'm sorry. I don't know how to stop it."
John wanted to yell to her that he did, but he didn't have the energy. 
The darkness consumed him.
	Cally turned to face the airing cupboard. Dolph came out warily.
"Wow." he remarked glancing at her father.
"I'm a monster."
"No you're not, you just don't know how to control it properly yet." He 
sensed this was not enough comfort to make her trust him. So he tried 
again. "You stopped didn't you?"
"Yeah."
"And you're not collapsing for a change."
At this point Cally brightened up considerably.
"Oh yeah."  Then her face turned green. "Oh no."
Dolph held out his arms as she fell into them. He dragged her into the 
bedroom to the left of the corridor. 
"Now you said something about a big cupboard in the room right?"
He got out a packet of cocaine from his pocket; it looked like Cally 
needed a boost.
       It was around this time that Jo got home. Dolph heard the door 
open downstairs and raced down to stop her from entering. Too late. Jo 
opened the door.
"Dolph!"
"Er- Jo!"
"What are you doing here? Get out! You're not welcome."
"I'm welcome wherever my girlfriend is." Dolph retorted.
"Where is Cally?"
"In her bedroom."
"Leave her alone. She may be deluded into thinking that you care about 
her but I know better!"
Jo reached for the landline phone but he slapped her hand away.
"What do you want the phone for?" he asked with an evil grin on his 
face.
"DAD!" Jo yelled. "DAD! DOLPH IS HERE!" No reply. "What have you 
done to him?"
"He's busy in his stupid room." Dolph lied. 
Jo glanced at him. He was barring her way and forcing her to back 
towards the open door. If she wasn't careful then she'd be locked out of 
the house. 
"What's that over there?!" Jo exclaimed squinting. 
Dolph looked over his shoulder and she used that opportunity to duck 
underneath his arm and race upstairs. 
"Come back here you bitch!" Dolph yelled after her.
Jo kept going up the stairs. She took one look at her father, who was 
lying on the floor unconscious and ran into her bedroom to find her 
mobile phone. What had Dolph done to him? There she saw her sister 
lying on the bed and the packet beside her. She fingered the plastic of 
the package.
"Cally you'd never do this, what has he done to you?"
 Then her eyes widened in realisation. He hadn't had to change Cally's 
mind about anything. He'd been force feeding her the drugs just waiting 
until she was vulnerable and wouldn't remember it in the morning. Jo 
saw her mobile phone on the desk beside the bed and grabbed it. But 
then she felt him grab her. She dropped the phone into her pocket and 
struggled against his grip as he tugged her back through the bedroom 
door, past her unconscious father and into the airing cupboard. She 
screamed as he threw her into the back of the cupboard. As her head hit 
the wall she saw stars. Dolph smirked. He had been wanting to do that 
for a while now. The door closed on her and Jo was dazed and trapped 
in the darkness. He took her confusion as an opportunity to find 
something to block the door. There was a shoving sound from outside 
the cupboard. Finally Jo came to her senses. She pushed against the 
door violently but heard a groan. It was at this point that Jo realised the 
thing keeping it shut was her father's unconscious body. She stopped 
abruptly, not wanting to hurt him. Jo peered through the keyhole and 
found Dolph leering back at her.
"If I hear a peep out of you tonight or tomorrow you're dead meat. You 
hear me?" Forgetting that he couldn't see her Jo nodded. He rapped 
loudly on the door and she jumped in fear. "YOU HEAR ME?"
"I hear you." Jo replied meekly. She hated this but she had her own way 
of irritating him. "I hear you Dolphin."
"Don't call me that!" he bellowed. There was a thud but it was more 
muffled and came from lower down the door this time. Jo had a 
sickening suspicion as to what Dolph had just done. "Don't call me that 
or I'll kick your old man again."
"Okay." Jo said quickly.
But being Dolph, he kicked John Sanders again for good measure.
***
Rory could be a right couch potato when he wanted to. It was a hobby 
of his to see how long he could stay on the sofa for. His record was two 
hours, but then it was lunchtime so he'd had to have a break. However 
today he simply wasn't in the mood. He couldn't get his mind off of the 
case. Rory fidgeted in front of the TV unable to focus on the cheesy 
show he was forcing himself to watch (as he'd managed to lose the 
remote. Again). He hated to think that he was missing out on more of 
the action. The fact that Dolph had clubbed him just made the situation 
more interesting - he winced at the memory - as well as painful. He 
remembered that moment only too well; although he had a feeling he 
dramatized it somewhat. Plus Mark was right; he wanted to spend more 
time with Linda despite the bizarre conversation they'd had yesterday 
about why she put him on the case with her.






















Chapter 7
 She'd said he reminded her of her late husband, well he needed time to 
show her that he was his own man. Spending the day at home was 
wasting a lot of that valuable time. Rory had got so bored just sitting 
around that he went upstairs to the loft where he rediscovered an old 
Lego set he used to play with when he was just a kid. Since he wasn't 
planning on going out he'd spent the rest of the day in front of the TV 
playing with the stuff. Rory glanced down at his creation, only noticing 
what he'd built now. It was a miniature version of the police station. 
Pleased and slightly embarrassed by his childish work he took a picture 
of the model using the camera on his phone. For a minute he 
considered sending it to Mark but then decided against it. A picture like 
this one could only be used for blackmail. After he tired of this activity 
Rory decided to do something one of his old English teachers had 
suggested. He'd always thought that the old crone of a woman wouldn't 
catch him dead doing this, but now he had nothing better to do. He 
read a dictionary. In it he discovered a new word, well a word he didn't 
know at least, that meant small, or possibly brave. Dictionary language 
was a bit too posh for Rory to understand at times. The word was: 
bantam. He should use that on Mark just to see his confused expression. 
After that Rory had managed to find an old toy kitten his sister used to 
own as a child, it too was hidden away in the loft. Just looking at the 
play thing made him smile. He had dropped the kitten named 'Ginger' in 
the toilet a few weeks after his sister had got it. To this very day its fur 
was extremely ruffled up from that incident. Rather amusingly the result 
had been that the hair partly covered the cat's eyes giving it a 
permanently angry expression. That, along with the pungent stench put 
his sister off Ginger for a good few years. He stroked the toy fondly 
before placing it on the windowsill to keep watch. Playing with a toy 
kitten, Lego and a dictionary? 
"I really am bored." he murmured to himself.
Fortunately he could tell from the dark sky, whose shadow loomed 
through the window onto Ginger (it made the cat look even more 
menacing, like a warrior of the night in Rory's eyes), that it was getting 
late. Rory yawned and was about to start getting ready for bed when he 
remembered something. He'd left his watch at work.
	To anyone else this may not have been a problem, but for him it 
was a major one. That watch was the sole reason he got up in the 
mornings. It was his alarm clock. So Rory set off for the police station. As 
he walked through the chilly air admiring the royal navy of the 
darkening sky part of him wondered if Linda would still be in her office 
at this time. Half of him hoped she was so he could make a start on not 
being Michael, whilst the rest of him hoped she wasn't so she could give 
herself a well-deserved rest. That woman was far too responsible for 
her own good. 
	Rory arrived. The place was silent. It seemed that as soon as 
people could escape they did. In a way it reminded him a little of high 
school. He wandered over to his desk. Sure enough, the digital watch lay 
there. He picked it up, attached it to his wrist and was about to leave 
when he heard a strange noise. It was coming from Linda's office. 
Slightly unnerved he picked up the taser lying on his desk amongst 
paperwork. His hand clutched it securely by his side as he approached 
the door. He opened it suddenly and held the taser up. But nobody had 
broken in. Rory now knew that there was no danger, only his paranoia 
acting up. He quickly brought down the taser. He could feel his cheeks 
burning scarlet. Linda looked up. The skin around her eyes was a blotchy 
red. She was crying. He'd never heard the fierce officer sob before. He 
felt like he was intruding on something immensely personal. So Rory left 
the office briefly and dragged up a chair so he was sitting beside her in 
the doorway. She was not going to escape this counselling session.
"What's wrong?"
"It, it just hits me sometimes." Rory was confused but gave her the time 
to explain. "T-the funeral today, I went there to interview Diane's 
parents and it j-just brought back a lot of bad memories."
"Like what?"	
"Like Michael's funeral."
"Oh." Rory had somehow managed to forget that she was still getting 
over Michael's death. She always acted so strong and independent; he'd 
never seen her like this before. "Tell me about Michael."
"He was a bit of a geek, he worked as a teacher and he was the 
sweetest guy. I-I've ever-" Linda trailed off, unable to continue due to 
sobbing. 
"Hey, hey look at me." Her head glanced up so her eyes met his. Rory 
moved his chair so he was sitting right next to her, there was barely 
enough space for it in the small office, but it was only from this position 
that he could hug her properly. He did it without thinking; it was a reflex 
which was just as well otherwise he would have never worked up the 
nerve to hug her in the first place. Her body convulsed in his arms as she 
cried and her breath felt warm against his shoulder. Rory was almost 
reluctant to let go but managed to pass it off as an amusing remark. "I 
suppose I'd better stop now before you get snot all over my shirt."
She laughed and wiped away her tears absent-mindedly.
"I take back what I said yesterday, you're nothing like Michael."
Rory smiled. Exactly. But he was curious to understand how he'd 
succeeded in making her say those four words.
"In what way?"
"When I think of him I- I get depressed beyond belief, when I think of 
you I'm happy."
Rory wasn't quite sure what to say to that. He wanted to tell her that he 
knew the feeling but seeing as he hadn't even known Michael it would 
be insensitive. Plus he would be talking about understanding how it felt 
to be happy when she saw him, which would make him seem a bit 
arrogant. What he meant was - 
"I feel the same whenever I see you." Linda smiled, her cheeks 
reddening slightly. It had been a long time since anyone had said 
something that sweet to her. Rory suddenly felt incredibly awkward. 
"Anyways, I only came here to get my watch; shouldn't you be getting 
home at this time?"
"Probably." she sniffed.
Up went the armour. Nice the moment had been, but now it was gone.
***
Jo was exhausted. She couldn't stand this. First there'd been the 
emotional turmoil of the funeral, but now her current situation was on a 
whole new level. She was stuck. In an airing cupboard. With her injured 
father blocking the door and her unconscious sister trapped with a 
dangerous sixth former. She was in a mood for hyperventilating but 
knew it wouldn't help anyone, least of all her. She fumbled about in the 
dark as she reached for her mobile phone. Thank god it was on vibrate. 
Jo felt so tired; she rested her head against the wall wearily and closed 
her eyes. She wouldn't go to sleep - she was just resting her eyes. 
However when she opened them light was creeping in through the door 
cracks. She was awoken by Cally's alarm clock. Uh oh.
	She could hear Dolph's grunts but there was little noise from 
Cally. This did nothing to ease Jo's tense mood. She had to call the 
police now, before he woke up fully. She started to dial the emergency 
services number. 
***
Rory didn't particularly want to come into work today. It was too early 
to get up in his opinion, his headache made him just want to take 
everything slowly. Weirdly enough it hurt worse than it had yesterday. 
However he forced himself to take an aspirin and set off. It was this 
attitude that made him slightly late. By the time he arrived at work 
Linda was waiting for him with an angry expression on her face. She was 
holding her phone next to her ear. Then she put her hand over it.
"Where have you been!?" she exclaimed gritting her teeth.
Startled by her tone Rory held up his hands in defence.
"What's the rush?"
Linda removed her hand from the phone.
"Hold please." Jo was thankful to not speak, Dolph was up now and she 
was afraid that if she made any noise he'd carry out his threat to kick 
her father further. Meanwhile however, back in the police department 
Linda stalked over to Rory and started to yell. "I JUST GOT PATCHED 
THROUGH TO JO SANDERS VIA THE EMERGENCY SERVICES! SHE'S 
TRAPPED IN AN AIRING CUPBOARD BY A BALLISTIC BOYFRIEND, HER 
FATHER'S BODY IS KEEPING THE DOOR CLOSED AND SHE'S HEARD NO 
SIGN OF HER SISTER SINCE SHE SAW HER THE EVENING BEFORE! AND 
YOU SAY WHAT'S THE RUSH!?"
"Okay, okay I'm sorry." he apologised hastily.
"YOU'RE ON THIS CASE FOR A REASON YOU KNOW! AT LEAST SHOW A 
LITTLE COMMITMENT."
Rory frowned. That made no sense. He knew that the only reason he 
was on this case was because Linda said he reminded her of her 
husband - but wait. Since the conversation they had last night he didn't 
remind her of Michael anymore.
"Why am I on this case Linda?"
She ignored him and started talking into the phone again.
"Don't worry; we'll be there as soon as we can."
"Please hurry." Jo whispered.
Linda hung up and stormed out of the police department. Rory noticed 
that every man and woman in the police station was staring at him. 
Mark was smirking. Rory rolled his eyes.
"Nothing to see here." he announced.
The people tittered quietly and reluctantly swivelled their eyes away 
from the scene. Rory started to chase after his partner, wondering why 
she was so angry all of a sudden. Okay he'd been a little bit late, but her 
reaction was a lot louder than he'd expected it would be. Plus she 
hadn't answered his question. 
	By the time he caught up to her she was already in the police 
car, lights flashing, whilst giving him a powerful glare. Rory could see 
she wasn't the only one. There were several other police cars filled to 
the brim with uniformed officers, many of whom he recognised. It 
looked like they were going to surround the house. He got into the car 
and decided that maybe it was wisest to say nothing.
"We're getting back-up this time round." Linda growled. 
Rory nodded. She stepped on the pedal and the car screeched forwards. 
A smile tugged at the corner of her lips, one of the advantages to being 
a policewoman was that she was allowed to speed when she was in the 
right car. Rory gripped the sides of his seat tightly. When Linda drove 
like this it was scary. After several minutes of swerving wildly through 
London traffic and narrowly missing a removal van he'd had enough.
"Did I do something? Why are you being so reckless!?" he screeched, in 
perfect tune with the loud noise the tyres were making. Linda turned on 
the radio, still refusing to listen to him. His groan was barely heard over 
the loud opera of radio three. The volume was ridiculously high and was 
making his headache worse. "Oh real mature, go into strop mode will 
you? You're as bad as Mark! Won't you just tell me what's wrong?" Rory 
yelled. Once again she pretended not to hear him. "IF YOU DON'T TURN 
THIS MUSIC DOWN DOLPH WILL HEAR US MILES AWAY!" 
No response. This time round it had got to a very loud point in the opera 
and he didn't think that Linda could even genuinely hear him. He 
moaned quietly as his head pounded and closed his eyes. When he did 
this the radio turned off. So she'd decided to take pity on him at last 
then. If his head hadn't been so sore Rory would've started to yell again.
"We're here."
He opened his eyes and stepped out of the car. As he did so he was 
puzzled by Linda's expression. She looked kind of sheepish. She stared 
at her feet and mumbled something indistinguishable.
"What?"
"I-I'm sorry."
"Huh?"
But now she'd turned and was confronting the other members of police 
giving them instructions on how to surround the house and everything. 
She turned back to meet his confused gaze.
"Come on, we're going in."
***
Jo could hear her sister getting up. That meant she had to be okay, 
right? Dolph walked out onto the landing and kicked her father.
"Remember what I said!" he hissed menacingly through the keyhole. Jo 
said nothing. He backed away from the door and joined Cally as she left 
the room. "Remember what I said Cal, just don't look."
"I'm not." Cally said, her voice wavering slightly. Jo peered through the 
keyhole and was able to just about see him accompanying her sister to 
the staircase. She was still wearing the clothes she'd worn yesterday 
and, from what Jo could tell, looked absolutely knackered. "Where's Jo? 
Did she come home last night?"
"Don't worry I dealt with her."
"Good, I don't want her accusing you of more ridiculous things. Dad 
included. It was her fault. Everything was her fault."
Jo narrowed her eyes. Cally was in denial. Then the doorbell rang. Jo 
saw Dolph and Cally exchange panicked glances. 
"We're not home okay?" Dolph said to Cally.
She nodded. Jo decided now was the right time to make some noise.
"HELP! I'M UP HERE!"
There was the sound of loud banging and a sudden crunch as Linda 
broke down the front door. Rory grinned. Now he could say his 
favourite line. This was the reason why he'd become a policeman. 
"Freeze! Put your hands up!" he called.
He wasn't particularly expecting them to listen. Linda raced up the stairs 
but Dolph beat her to the airing cupboard. He kicked Jo's father out of 
the way, opened the door and dragged Jo out of it. She was putting up a 
pretty violent struggle but he had the advantage of being so much taller 
than her. He was also a little stronger. Jo let out a piercing scream.
"Get off me you Dolphi-"
He bent her arms back and she yelled harder. Dolph lowered his head 
down to her height. 
"You finish that sentence and I'll break your arms. I'll twist them so far 
back that even in Australia they'll hear the click as your shoulder snaps!" 
he whispered then he raised his voice to yell at the police. "Stay away 
from us! Or I'll-I'll strangle her if I have to!" he finished lamely.
Linda raised an eyebrow, she'd heard far worse threats than that but 
this one was still dangerous for Jo. Realising this wasn't the most 
productive threat Dolph put his arms under Jo's chin and tightened his 
grip just to show the police what he was capable of. Jo started to gasp. 
Her mouth opened and closed in a panic reminiscent of a goldfish's 
expression. Cally watched, but did nothing. Linda could only watch 
helplessly. Rory, however, had had enough. First the boy clubbed him, 
now he was strangling an innocent girl. He lifted his gun and aimed. 
Rory pulled down on the trigger and the bullet came whizzing out of the 
gun hole, hitting Dolph's shoulder. He yelped in pain and his arms fell to 
his side. One was bleeding and fell limply, whilst his uninjured arm 
cradled the other. Jo staggered away, recovered her breath and took 
the opportunity to kick Dolph in the crotch before joining the police 
triumphantly. Cally's eyes narrowed and she stood in front of her 
boyfriend.
"HOW DARE YOU! HE'S A BETTER HUMAN BEING THAN YOU'LL EVER 
BE!" she snarled at the group.
Dolph was the only person she felt could accept her for who she was. A 
monster. It was his "love" for her that helped her start to believe what 
she was capable of causing. She stared at the policemen and one by one 
they started to clutch their ears.
"Rory can you hear that?" said Linda, yelling over the noise of high 
pitched giggles only they could hear. 
Neither of them noticed the large light above dripping an oily black 
liquid onto their foreheads. The wiring that rooted the light into the 
ceiling was shaking along with the rest of the bulb. Fortunately Jo who 
had been released from Dolph's clutches barely seconds ago saw this 
development. She leapt at them and pushed the pair to one side. 
Together the trio narrowly avoided the blackened light bulb that 
crashed to the ground where they'd all been standing previously. Cally 
was still angry but Dolph used his free arm to tug her away from it all.
"Don't waste your strength." he said, knowing that he'd still need hers. 
Jo glanced at Rory and Linda. They both looked rather disorientated 
from what they'd heard. She stared after Dolph and Cally as they made 
a run past her for the back door. Without adults on her side she knew 
she didn't stand a chance. Jo had no choice but to watch them escape, 
she was utterly helpless. She looked down. Her father lay squashed 
against the banisters from when Dolph had shoved him out of the way 
in order to get to her. She ran over to him and knelt by his side. 
"Dad?" He remained immobile. "Dad please tell me you're okay!" He 
mumbled something incoherently. "What?"
"Do I look okay?" he repeated, his eyes half open, half closed. Jo felt a 
wave of relief wash over her. At least he was now able to talk. "I'm - so 
sorry. This is all my fault."
"What? Dad how is this your fault?"
"The contamination -" but he trailed off. 
"Dad? Dad! Stay with me!"
Jo felt all the soap opera lines flooding through her as if they were 
natural speech. 
"Don't panic darling - I'm fine -" he reassured ineffectively.
"Dad you're a rubbish liar." 
Jo could feel the tears pricking her eyes like tiny needles.
"- go into my study."
"What?"
"You - heard."
"But-"
"I've made an antidote - for Cally's condition - Haemofrost - she has to 
drink it -"
"Don't talk dad, you're not making any sense. You're not well."
" - well - duh -" he muttered before his eyes closed for the last time.
"Dad!" Jo screamed. The tears gushed from her eyes. This seemed to 
snap the police out of their strange trance. "I need an ambulance. I 
need one NOW!" 
Even to Rory's untrained eye he could tell that John Sanders was dead. 
He cautiously approached Jo and put his hand on her shoulder.
"He'd dead." He said gently.
"ARE YOU A DOCTOR?"
"No, but -"
"SO SHUT UP. GET AN AMBULANCE HERE NOW!"
Rory didn't know what good it would do but went out to see if any of 
the policemen surrounding the house had caught Dolph and Cally as 
they left. Linda dialled for an ambulance.
***
When Rory stepped outside at first everything appeared normal. Mark 
was there with prepared sarcastic comments about the argument Rory 
and Linda had had earlier.
"Looks like you two are going to break up before you even get 
together!"
"Mark shut up." Rory sighed. 
He wasn't in the mood for his messing around.
"Hey what's wrong?"
"A man's just died. Please tell me someone caught the culprits."
Mark's teasing grin faded and was replaced with a serious look.
"I heard nothing from the other guys."
"Let's check on them then."
Together the pair walked round to the back of the house. The men 
looked drunk from the way they were stumbling about. Rory stared at 
Mark questioningly.
"What happened?" asked Mark, equally surprised.
One of the nearer officers made her way over to the pair. Rory knew the 
lady; she was a good policewoman. Mark had accused him of fancying 
her too (although this time it was partly out of jealousy) so he had been 
steering clear of her lately. If anything he thought Mark fancied her.
"They came out of the house and we were all ready, but as we started 
to go in there was this high pitched giggling, I couldn't get it out of my 
head, it took over everything I just - by the time it was gone so were 
they." Mark stared at the officer incredulously but Rory understood 
exactly what she meant. The policewoman stared at her feet. "I'm going 
to lose my job aren't I." 
It was a statement, not a question. Mark looked ready to nod.
"No. Look around you El; you're not the only person this affected."
She followed Rory's instructions and this cheered her up slightly. 
"What do you want us to do?"
"Shouldn't you be asking Linda?"
El and Mark exchanged knowing looks when they heard Rory say the 
name 'Linda'. Rory rolled his eyes. So he didn't use her surname the 
whole time, what was the big deal?
"She's not here and you are." pointed out Mark.
A little startled by his sudden position of authority Rory was unsure of 
what to say at first but then it became clear.
"Erm...get everyone to patrol the area. We're looking for Dolph 
Andrews and Cally Sanders. You already know who Dolph is and you 
should recognise Cally from the news. Understand me?" El nodded. 
"Good. Spread the word."
El started to walk back into the crowd.
***
Aileen received the call in the middle of an important meeting. It was 
rather embarrassing. Everyone stared at her as her ringtone loudly went 
off in the hall. The head of the table looked at her with an expression 
that could shatter the strongest of nerves and spoke. Her boss was not 
known for his sympathetic behaviour. 
"You'd better answer it then."
Aileen picked up her phone. The longer the conversation, the more 
humiliated she would be by the end of the meeting.
"Hello, this is a really bad time." she hissed.
"There's no good time for bad news."
"Stop talking in riddles and get to the point before I hang up on you! 
Who is this anyways?"
"This is Linda Porter speaking, head of the police department." That 
made sense, Aileen recognised the voice. "There's no easy way to say 
this so I'll just come out with it. Your husband is dead."
"Oh my god." Aileen felt numb. She no longer got on with John but she 
had once loved him and she'd certainly never wished this upon him. The 
worst part was the irony. Today, after work and everything she and John 
were finally going to get their papers signed together and they'd be 
officially divorced. It looked like her ex hadn't even made it that far. 
Aileen could feel the tears start to trickle down her cheeks but the shock 
limited their impact. Linda was simply glad that the woman wasn't 
yelling yet. "What happened?"
"We're not entirely sure yet but we think it was something to do with 
Cally and her abusive boyfriend."
"YOU FIND OUT THIS INSTANT!" Aileen yelled, forgetting she was still in 
the meeting.
"We will try our best but it will take time. Jo is with me now."
"What's Jo doing there?" she questioned in horror.
"Crying mostly, she needs picking up."
Aileen wondered what made Linda think that she was any different. 
"I'm in the middle of a meeting!" she exclaimed.
"We can keep Jo at the station until you get home. What time will you 
get back?"
"It depends." Aileen sighed glancing at her angry boss. She had a feeling 
he was going to make her pay for this interruption. "I'll phone Jo as soon 
as I've finished."
"How about you come to the police station to pick her up once you're 
done?"
"Okay. Goodbye."
Aileen hung up. The hall was silent. She put her head in her hands as 
everything came crashing down around her. She started to sob. 
Everything was going wrong. First it had been the parties, then there'd 
been the drugs, then there'd been Dolph and now this? It was a 
combination of her worst fears combined. One of her more friendly co-
workers who sat beside her nervously patted Aileen on the back.
"There there." she said soothingly but her alarmed eyes told a different 
story.
Aileen's boss remained unforgiving. His glare was unfathomable.
"Aileen." She said nothing. "AILEEN." 
She looked up.
"Yes?"
"Do you have an excuse for being an insufferable interruption?"
Many of Aileen's co-workers took a sharp intake of breath at his harsh 
question. They all knew that she didn't get on with him. They also knew 
that when Aileen disagreed with someone she tended to explode. 
Easily. They watched her with bated breath but to their surprise she did 
no such thing.
"My husband is dead." Aileen deadpanned; her expression as blank as 
her tone.
It was too much effort and pain to feel the conflicting emotions writhing 
about her insides so she'd decided to simply ignore them. Maybe if she 
blocked them out they would stop existing.
"Oh."
The man's expression would have been almost funny if it weren't for the 
circumstances. Whatever he had been expecting he had not been 
expecting that.
***
Jo sat in the police department staring into space. The ambulance had 
eventually come as promised but she could tell from the looks on the 
paramedics faces that her father stood no chance. Her worst fears were 
realised. He was gone. Jo couldn't even cry anymore. She just sat there 
watching people flit past her, part of a life she felt she could never have 
again, Jo felt like she was stuck in slow motion. She was trapped in a 
place far crueller than the airing cupboard.
	Rory peered through the blinds of Linda's office at Jo. She 
looked so dejected. It was understandable really; this was the second 
death she was suffering from in only a few days. Occasionally police 
walked past, giving her sympathetic looks but it made little difference to 
the outcome. Linda cleared her throat and he reluctantly turned to face 
her. They'd been doing this for a good twenty minutes at the very least 
and he still felt like they were going round in circles. 
"Where would they go?"
"Linda we've looked at all the options! We've got police patrolling 
Aileen's house, John's house, Gayle's house, Lolita's flat and streets in 
general around the area! A lot of people are on duty. All we can do is 
wait."
"Well I'm not going to sit around whilst our possible culprits escape! Yes 
we may have been scouring the records for a while now but for all we 
know there might even be a third person to the murders. You heard 
that laughter just as well as I did."
"I don't think there was anyone laughing, I think we just heard it." he 
pondered.
"Rory if I was crazy I wouldn't be head of the police department."
"Hitler became the German prime minister." he argued.
Linda groaned.
"Let's go over this again shall we?"
"Fine."
"They could go to school, which is highly unlikely because it's way too 
obvious and stupid a plan -"
"No wait, that's the only place Dolph can go."
"Don't be stupid Rory."
"Listen to me, everywhere else whether it's houses of family or not, will 
be expecting them and will be surrounded. School is the one place 
we're not patrolling because we didn't think he'd be stupid enough to 
turn up after the day's antics."
"Your point is?"
"I'm not done yet! They'll go to the school because it's the only place 
we won't be expecting them."
She sighed.
"Don't make me yell at you again."
"I'm serious, they could be there. Why were you yelling at me earlier 
anyways?"
"For reasons I thought were obvious."
"Okay so I was a little late, big deal. You've never flown off the hook at 
me like that before." 
"Let's get back to the point. There's no way they'd go to school! They're 
kids. They'll make the most out of bunking when they can!"
"At the very least we should notify the school."
"Fine!"
Rory watched as Linda picked up her phone and dialled the school's 
number.
"How do you know what number to call anyways?" he asked.
She gave him a withering look.
"My husband was a teacher!" she snapped.
There was no doubt about it, Linda was angry about something extra, 
she just wouldn't tell him what. Feeling slightly hurt he decided to leave.
"I'll just leave you two alone then!" He walked out of the office and 
closed the door behind him. He couldn't help her if she refused to tell 
him what was wrong. It was quite frustrating really. To make matters 
worse Mark lay in wait for him. The irritating friend opened his mouth, 
ready to make a sarcastic comment but Rory cut him off. "If you're not 
going to say anything worthwhile then don't speak."
Mark's grin disappeared.
"If you're upset with Porter don't take it out on me." he huffed.
Rory sighed heavily. He knew that his friend was right for a change.
"Sorry. Look did anything happened this morning or yesterday that 
really annoyed Linda?"
Mark shrugged.
"Not that I'm aware of. Maybe she's on her period."
Maybe Mark was right, but Rory didn't think so. He was about to ask his 
friend another question about their boss but then Linda came out of the 
office.
"Rory!" she called. 
He could feel everyone's eyes boring into him.
"What have you done now?" whispered Mark.
"Shut up." he hissed back.
Rory walked forwards half expecting a slap from his superior. 
"You were right. I notified the school and they said that Dolph and Cally 
had arrived a few minutes ago, their excuse being that Cally collapsed 
on the way there and Dolph had managed to hurt his arm somehow. 
But its break time now so it'll be virtually impossible to find the kids 
amongst the crowd of them in the canteen." Rory could feel the 
smugness radiating out from his chest and smile. "You were right once, 
don't get too cocky." said Linda as she strode towards the exit but then 
something made her stop and stare.
"What is it?"
"Where's Jo gone?"
***
Jo had snuck out of the police station at least ten minutes ago now, 
wanting to go back to her father's house. She still had the key on her. 
The department wasn't too far away from the place and she'd been 
watching the route taken carefully through the windows of the police 
car on their way to the station. Despite the empty void inside her one 
thing had kept on circling her mind. Her father's last words had been "- 
well - duh -", not the most poetic, but he'd been trying to tell her 
something before that. His words echoed in her head. "I've made an 
antidote - for Cally's condition - Haemofrost - she has to drink it -". As 
these thoughts cascaded through Jo's mind she found herself in front of 
her house but a policeman stepped in her way.
"What are you doing here? I thought Porter took you back to the 
station?"
"It's my house; I'm allowed to visit aren't I?"
The man didn't look convinced.
"Sorry but this is a crime scene now."
"I forgot something okay? I have Porter's permission to go in. Or would 
you like me to tell your superior you didn't listen?"
The man nervously stepped aside at this point. Jo smirked, the right 
words worked like magic. She made her way through the front door 
ready to use the same excuse if she was stopped by anyone else. 
However her impact on that man must've spread as the other officers 
seemed to be obviously avoiding her. She got inside with no trouble at 
all. Jo took a deep breath. She was afraid of going back near that airing 
cupboard. The memories would be too much. She ran for it. Jo sprinted 
up the stairs and into the study. She slammed the door behind her and 
leant on it whilst she regained her breath. As she panted she scanned 
the room for the mysterious Haemofrost her dad had mentioned. She 
didn't know why he'd been working on a cure in the first place but from 
the diagram she'd seen earlier she knew that he had found out a lot 
about Cally's condition. Not for the first time she wondered what her 
father's job had been, but it was pointless worrying about it now. It 
wasn't like he was around anymore to hide it from her. Jo swallowed 
her grief temporarily and started to search the room. She longed for her 
father to come out from the shadows, to hug her and ask her whether 
she'd really been that easily fooled by his death. She wanted him to tell 
her that his job had been working on an immortality potion of some 
kind, but Jo's desperation was merely creating fantasies. She knew that 
what she wished for would never happen. But she could at least put a 
stop to Cally's powers. That was a reality she was willing to manipulate. 
	Jo wiped the papers from the desk, examined every single test 
tube and started to ransack the cupboards until finally she found a 
purple container. It was labelled Haemofrost and two nozzles came out 
from it, the ends covered in Clingfilm. Whatever her father had been up 
to, he'd been determined enough to design his own little contraption. Jo 
grabbed it and set off for school. She had a bad feeling that she knew 
exactly what Dolph wanted to do. His plan was unfolding and she 
seemed to be the only person who could see it clearly. If only Cally 
could. If her sister realised what her boyfriend was really up to he'd be 
dead meat.
***
Dolph grinned despite the pain in his arm as he and Cally made their 
way into the canteen. It was filled to the brim with pupils. On the way 
out of John's house he'd grabbed a set of school uniform for Cally to 
wear to help them blend in with the crowd. He didn't need to worry 
about uniform, he was a sixth former. So far it was working out 
perfectly. It was a shame that he hadn't had time to grab a cloth to 
bandage up his arm with. But never mind, phase one was complete: 
they'd just bought a couple of cakes from the canteen. In fact, Dolph 
had bought Cally's for her. As he left the till he handed it to her.
"Thanks Dolph, you're so sweet." Cally cooed.
But he hadn't done that just to be nice. He'd done it so he could slip a 
little something into her food. It was a very powerful something this 
time round, now all he needed was to get her annoyed at the right time 
and place and all his enemies would be obliterated. Timing was 
everything. 
	They walked slowly round the canteen in circles searching for a 
free table but as per usual there was little space. Dolph winced as 
schoolchildren pushed past him in the crowd. It made the pain in his 
arm worse, but all the same he led the way, waiting until he saw Mrs 
Richardson on duty. Once this was done he could get all the treatment 
he needed with Cally's inevitable threats to the hospital staff if they 
didn't fix him up good. Sure enough there the teacher was by the door 
leading out of the place. He grinned and picked a stupid place to stand 
as he noticed Jo's friends walk past. They glared at him but split around 
his attempt to block them. Several of them knocked into him on 
purpose, it hurt but he no longer cared. There was something much 
more important at stake now. Dolph had just effectively herded them 
towards Mrs Richardson. Then he gaped. He couldn't believe his luck as 
Callum Fields walked over to the exit holding a bowl of half eaten pasta. 
This kid had bettered him in badness, reputation and girlfriends for the 
majority of Dolph's time in secondary school. This sixth former was 
going to pay for his position. Dolph glanced behind him to check that 
Cally was still by his side but spotted the two members of police from 
earlier. They were by the tills questioning staff and watching the 
students closely. Maybe his luck was starting to run out. He had to get 
this done quickly. Dolph turned his focus back to the crowd of people by 
the exit.
"Cally?" he called just to double check she was still standing next to him.
No reply. Dolph turned around again. The police were coming this way. 
He started to speed walk in the opposite direction. 
	Jo was finally managing to talk to her sister. This was the closest 
she'd ever get to chatting to Cally alone. She eyed the hoard of pupils 
present in the canteen. This was not one of her most impressive feats, 
but it would have to do. She knew she had to be careful about what she 
said. Accusing Dolph of things, no matter how solid the evidence was, 
would get her nowhere. Jo knew from experience.
"What are you doing here!? You kicked Dolph!" exclaimed Cally.
 Jo bit back the retort of: you killed dad, and forced herself to reply with 
the answer she'd prepared on the way over.
"I'm sorry. I messed up. You are right. You and Dolph have always been 
right. I'm just the little sister who gets in the way, I can see it now. I just 
wanted to apologise to your face."
For a few moments Cally said nothing. Then she smiled. It was all 
working out.
"Thank you for finally coming round. Now will you admit that you killed 
Diane?"
Jo gulped, this was the biggest lie of all time but she knew it was vital to 
win back her sister's trust.
"Y-yes."
"Then I'll have to turn you in. The police are here you know."
Cally turned to walk over to them but Jo put a hand on her shoulder.
"Wait! Can't I at least give you this small peace offering?"
She held out the Haemofrost container. She'd ripped off the label 
however so it simply appeared to be a strangely shaped purple box with 
nozzles coming out from it.
"What is it?" asked Cally eyeing the small contraption incredulously.
"I got it from Liza." Cally's eyes widened. Liza was a sister of a friend; 
she provided a lot of the alcoholic supplies for the parties she held 
before her parents had found out about them. "Do I really need to say 
anymore?"
Jo was screaming inside for her sister to take the bait, Cally considered 
it slowly. 
"No, you don't. Just give it here." Cally snatched it from her sister's hand 
and moved the nozzles carefully so they were both pointing into her 
mouth before gulping the liquid down. She pulled a face. "Well thanks 
for the tainted batch!" she snapped at Jo and continued to move 
towards the police but this time Dolph intervened, pulling her away 
from the crowd of people gathering by the exit. The police were 
interviewing Mrs Richardson.
"Aren't you going to eat your cake?" asked Dolph.
"I'm not really that hungry."
It was true, that drink Jo had given her made her feel rather full and 
rather cold. Her teeth were chattering.
"Come on, I bought that thing especially for you."
"Okay then."
Jo watched the pair from a distance, crossing her fingers. This had to 
work. It had to be quick too, from the looks of things she didn't have 
much time before Dolph tried the next stage of his plan.
	Cally bit into the cake and Dolph smiled as he clutched his 
wounded arm. It was working. 
"Dolph how is your arm?" asked Cally, noticing the way he was holding 
it.
"Painful."
"You should go to hospital."
"No, no not yet I'll survive."
"Are you sure?"
"Yeah."
"You should at least put something on it."
"I'll be fine." he said, before giving her a strange look. "Why are you 
shaking?"
"Because it's freezing in here!" Cally complained.
"No it isn't."
"Well at least someone is warm!"



Chapter 8
Dolph stood in front of Cally, blocking her view, now was the perfect 
time.
"Watch out!" he said to her.
Then he threw his cake at Callum. Cally of course could see none of this. 
She only saw Dolph duck as Callum retaliated with the throwing of his 
pasta. The food hit her square in the face. She screamed in a mixture of 
disgust and anger as the sauce dripped down her chin. Callum looked 
genuinely scared. Dolph grinned as he stood and moved to one side. All 
attention was on Cally. Her eyes narrowed and she tried to focus her 
anger, but the white dot that normally appeared on her victims all the  
times before refused to show itself. Jo smiled. Mission accomplished. 
Suddenly Cally felt a lot warmer and healthier. The sheen of sweat from 
her last collapse seemed to fade away. Unable to fathom why her 
powers had suddenly disappeared Cally threw her half eaten cake at 
Callum. It missed and hit Ettie. From there on all hell was unleashed. 
Mrs Richardson started to yell at the children but simply got smothered 
by a pile of sandwiches thrown in her direction. Jo armed herself by 
grabbing a bottle of orange juice from a nearby kid's hand. The police 
decided now was their chance to move forward but found themselves 
caught in the midst of a huge food fight. 
       Dolph realised that Cally's powers no longer seemed to work. 
His face turned red at first, then purple as he started to run from the 
incoming police. All that work, for nothing! Cally turned when she 
realised he was leaving.
"Dolph!" she called. He span round on the spot. "Where are you going?"
"Anywhere that isn't here! Oh and thanks for announcing my name to 
the authorities!" he yelled over the chaos of the food and screaming 
children.
"I'll come with you."
"NO. Don't you get it?"
"Get what?"
"You're clingy, shout-y, high and annoying!"
"What? High?"
"Yes high you bozo! I put cocaine in your cake after all!"
But he could tell from her expression that she still didn't understand.
"Dolph what are you trying to say?"
He was angry, he wasn't really thinking anymore.
"I DON'T LOVE YOU IDIOT! WE WERE OVER A LONG TIME AGO AND I 
ONLY STUCK AROUND FOR YOUR POWERS."
At this yell the canteen went silent. Miraculously Jo had managed to get 
through the majority of the food fight with only a sauce stain on her 
clothes. She put the orange juice bottle down to one side and stopped 
spraying with it. Everyone was frozen listening to the angry couple's 
yells.
"A-are you breaking up with me?"
"YES!"
Then a look of realisation crossed Cally's face. At first her expression 
displayed the hurt inside her, and then it darkened to a look of rage.
"Were you drugging me to boost my powers?"
"YES!"
"Were you using me?"
At this point Dolph's confidence began to fall. He remembered his 
wounded arm. Of course, he had been using her but if he admitted it 
she would go mental. Jo sensed his hesitation and stepped forwards.
"Yes he was Cally."
"STAY OUT OF THIS JO I WANT TO HEAR IT FROM HIM."
"Cally you need to listen to me. Dolph has been using you to get rid of 
his enemies." Jo decided to ramp her speech up a little and jumped up 
onto the table top so everyone could see her. "WHO REMEMBERS MR 
PORTER?" Linda gasped. Rory looked at her. They both knew the girl 
was talking about her late husband. Several hands flew up into the air. 
Jo felt a little like she was conducting an assembly. "Good. Do you 
remember how he ended up?" The hands rose into the air again, this 
time with a little less enthusiasm. How could anyone forget that horrible 
news story? She turned her attention back to Dolph who was backing 
away from his angry girlfriend. "Dolph never liked him, Dolph never 
liked Diane and he's definitely never liked Mrs Richardson. What's the 
connection? I'll tell you: two out of three ended up dead and Mrs had a 
near death experience with that projector." The crowd of schoolchildren 
started to murmur in agitation. "And now he's killed my dad."
"Jo this has nothing to do with me!" Cally exclaimed. She turned on 
Dolph again. "It's all his fault."
"It has everything to do with you! He manipulated you! He made you 
love him. You admitted it on more than one occasion. You were there 
on the night when Diane died why don't you tell us what happened?"
All eyes were on Cally.
"It's none of your business." she said quietly.
"Liar. She was my friend too! Or did you forget?" She paused to make 
sweeping eye contact with every member of the audience, 
remembering what her English teacher had taught her. A tiny part of 
her was enjoying this, she felt like a detective and now she could finally 
catch the criminals. "I wasn't the person who killed Diane, you were."
"WHAT? I'D NEVER DO THAT!" Cally yelled, but her panicked darting 
eyes told a different story.
"Dolph always hated Diane because she told the truth about him. It 
didn't take a genius to realise that he was spiking your drinks at the 
weekly parties. She wanted to warn you, but in doing so she accused 
Dolph and that's one thing you just can't take Cally. Criticism." She 
paused before saying the next part in a quieter tone. "Then you used 
your powers."
"I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING!"
"I'm not finished yet. After I found you I heard footsteps. Dolph was 
checking up on his dirty work. But I knew Diane. I know what she 
would've said. Diane's last words weren't 'it was Jo', she hadn't finished 
talking. She was going to say 'it was Jo who was right about him and I'm 
just passing on the message'. "
Cally repeated her earlier argument but this time with a bit less oomph.
"I didn't know what I was doing."
"Ignorance is no excuse. You're both under arrest." interrupted Linda. 
She stared at the kids. "What are you looking at? Haven't you got food 
to be eating?"
The normal canteen atmosphere resumed as the children attempted to 
avoid the policewoman's stare. 
	Rory who had been watching Linda's expression throughout the 
entirety of Jo's speech was worried. She'd wanted revenge on Michael's 
killer for so long, what would she do now she knew that the culprit was 
just a confused kid? Jo jumped down from the table and went over to 
join the policeman. 
"You worked all of that out?"
"I'm not a baby."
He smiled. 
"I never said you were." Then he hurried after Linda. She snapped the 
handcuffs around Cally's wrists. Cally barely struggled; she simply stood 
there staring at Dolph and then her sister, unable to believe the truth.  
Rory found himself dealing with the more evasive Dolph who was trying 
to run out of the canteen. It was easy enough to stop him though as the 
fellow students rallied round to help the policeman. Three year elevens 
barred the door whilst a year seven stuck out his foot and tripped Dolph 
up. He fell over hard onto the floor and moaned as his arm throbbed in 
reaction. Rory used the opportunity to cuff the teenager and dragged 
the boy to his feet. Linda wasn't glaring at the girl much to his surprise 
she simply looked lost like Jo had earlier that day in the police station. 
Linda felt like she had lost Michael all over again. Rory walked over to 
her. "Come on; let's get back to the police station." He glanced at Jo. 
"You too. Your mum will be waiting for you by now."
Jo waved goodbye to her friends who stood by the door, covered in 
food splatters. They waved back and as one, the group left.
	On the way to the police car Cally's anger finally took over. She 
ran at Dolph and started to pummel him with her handcuffed fists. She 
kicked at him too. He yelped in pain as she clawed at his arm.
"This is how you made me feel when you ruined my heart!" she hissed 
in his ear.
"Get her off me! She's mad!" Dolph yelled.
Linda watched the pair for a bit longer than necessary before telling 
Rory to separate them. Rory did so, but it was hard work. It seemed 
Cally was tricky to restrain. Eventually Linda pitched in when it was clear 
he was getting nowhere and together they got to the car. The pair 
exchanged glances as they realised it would be difficult to keep them 
apart when they got inside the vehicle.
"I'll call for back up shall I?" suggested Rory.
"Yes. You do that." agreed Linda.
	Within minutes of the call the separate car arrived. It was driven 
by Mark.
"Look who it is, surprise, surprise." mumbled Rory. He shoved Dolph 
into the car before his friend could say anything and told him to take 
Dolph to the police station. Mark looked affronted at not being given 
any time to speak but did as Rory said anyways. He turned to the others. 
"Let's go." 
Linda drove and Rory sat next to her reciting the legalities. 
"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be 
used against you in a court of law."
Cally chose to remain silent. She sat next to her sister saying nothing 
whatsoever. Jo had a feeling that Cally would never admit that her 
younger sister had been right. That just wasn't her way of doing things. 
Besides, because of Jo she'd probably end up going to jail.
	Thanks to traffic Mark had got Dolph to the station before the 
others arrived. Cally was put with him, which they all thought was a bad 
idea but there wasn't enough space to separate them again. On the 
bright side Cally hadn't launched another attack on Dolph. Yet. Jo found 
herself sitting in the waiting room but this time her mother was there to 
greet her. She finally let out her feelings about her father and together 
they cried on the bench. Rory explained what had happened to Aileen 
and was surprised by the lack of yelling. Maybe her temper had been 
kicked out of her after receiving Linda's phone call about her husband. 
He certainly hoped so. He turned to find himself facing Mark. 
"What do you want?" he asked wearily.
"First, an explanation." Rory launched into the day's antics and by the 
end Mark had a much better understanding of how his friend felt. When 
Rory finished speaking Mark glanced in Porter's direction and then 
spoke. "I know you've had a long and busy day so I'm not going to say 
much, other than look at Linda." Surprised by the maturity of his 
friend's response Rory did as he told him. The head of the police 
department looked like she was wilting like a dead flower. Linda didn't 
just feel her tired, sad feelings, she emitted them. "I don't care what 
you say; you need to talk to her."
"Okay. You're right." Rory admitted.
Mark patted him on the shoulder and went over to El. He pecked the 
policewoman on the cheek, she smiled and they both watched as Rory 
approached Linda.
"Thank you, my partner in crime." he said to her.
"My pleasure." she replied.
***
Rory stood by Linda. She stared at the bulletin board, fingering the pins. 
She was trying hard not to look at him. He felt uncomfortable; this was 
too formal for his liking.
"I'm so sorry Porter." he said.
"Don't call me that." she said softly.
"What?"
"Call me by my first name."
Well that was an unusual reaction to say the least.
"O-kay."
"I'm sorry about yelling at you earlier by the way, I was thinking about 
things in a little too much depth. Jo's conclusion wasn't far off mine."
"Oh." So that explained it. "She's a clever girl. I wouldn't be surprised if 
she became a detective when she's older." Rory said to fill the awkward 
silence between them.
"Yeah..."
Mark and El, overlooking the conversation from a distance, exchanged 
glances; this was not going as well as they'd hoped.
"Look if you need to talk -" Rory began.
"I don't."
Rory looked at her. He'd had enough of this.
"Yes you do, can't you see? You said yourself the reason I'm on this case 
is to correct your mistakes. It is my duty to give you a decent counselling 
session if you need one because quite frankly you do." Rory felt the 
words come tumbling out of his mouth as soon as he thought them. 
"You are too responsible, your mood swings are - well - irritating to say 
the least and you need to learn how to let go. Michael isn't here 
anymore. I'm sorry, but moping about it will get you nowhere. Thanks to 
our capturing of the two teenage delinquents who killed him in the first 
place you should consider the guy avenged! You'll meet someone else. 
That I'm sure of but the prospect is never going to occur if you don't 
lighten up!"
As soon as Rory finished speaking he put his hand over his mouth. He 
tensed. He was bound to be fired within the next few seconds now. But 
the condemning words never left her mouth.
"Thanks." she said.
"For what?"
"For putting me straight."
"Huh?"
"You're the first person to tell me that to my face."
"And that's a good thing?" questioned Rory in amazement.
"I like it when people are honest."
"Really?"
"Yes."
In fact, the more Linda thought about Rory the more she realised how 
he'd always been there for her. Even on the latest of nights at the office 
he'd managed to lose something and they'd wound up chatting. He had 
comforted her then and was doing it now, although sometimes he 
didn't even know it. At first she'd thought he was like Michael but then 
she realised he was so much more - Rory was alive for starters. Linda 
found herself thinking back to the irritating conversation she'd had with 
Mark and his voice seemed to echo through her head. 
"You act different around him you know."
That day she'd been ready to deny everything and anything but now - 
maybe, just maybe Mark was right. She looked at Rory, analysing him 
almost and immediately noticed how she'd begun to look at him 
differently. In many ways Rory had grown up. He was no longer the 
inexperienced young policeman who'd accidentally arrested a five year 
old for murder. He'd matured, plus he was pretty handsome on closer 
inspection. Linda couldn't believe she hadn't realised this before, but 
that friend of his had. She glanced in Mark's direction and saw he was 
standing with El. Ah. The pair were holding hands. He'd had help then.
	Rory however was still worried about Linda. This pondering 
silence had lasted several minutes now and he felt it was getting to the 
extreme end of what he liked to call The Awkward Scale. He felt like his 
head was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode as he tried to think of 
things to say. She was obviously upset about Michael, yes that had to be 
it. Maybe she just needed a little space. Her eyes looked unfocussed and 
far away as she stared at him. Rory smiled, her eyes were pretty. He 
mentally shook himself out of that idea and tried to focus on saying 
something appropriate to her.
"I'll just leave you to it then." he said.
Linda seemed to come out of her trance.
"Sorry, leave me to what?"
"Erm...your staring."
"What? Oh sorry."
"It's alright; you've got a lot on your plate. Are you okay Linda?"
"Yeah I was just thinking about something."
"Michael I'll bet." Rory muttered.
"Actually no."
"Oh." Rory shuffled his feet sheepishly. She wasn't meant to hear that, 
she was allowed to think about her dead husband after what they'd just 
discovered. "What were you thinking about then?"
"I was just considering something." Rory opened his mouth. "It wasn't 
about him before you ask." He closed it again. "I was thinking about 
this."
Linda stepped forwards, closing the space between them, his eyes 
widened in anticipation. He was half wondering whether he had 
annoyed her so it came as a pleasant surprise when she kissed him. At 
first his eyes widened in shock but then he closed them and melted into 
it. When Linda finally pulled away she was smiling. However the 
moment was spoiled slightly by the call from the corner of the police 
station behind them.
"It's about time!" said El.
"Yeah, but get a room you two!" Mark added.
Much to his surprise Rory noted a light blush appearing on Linda's 
cheeks. He took her by the hand and led her towards her office.
"We've got some time before we have to interview those kids."
She grinned.











Epilogue
Ten years later.

Jo was ready, it would be awkward in every manner of the word, but the 
important part was that she was mentally prepared. She just needed to 
not think about it. She would just think about travel arrangements, the 
tube should sort that out. She stepped into the crush of people and 
tried to avoid going on autopilot. If she focussed on every little detail 
instead of mixing it up into a vague blur then maybe she'd be able to 
avoid the thought of what she was going to -family get together. Too 
late. Jo slapped her head in annoyance. She had to stop doing that.
	Cally was on parole. This was the only reason the whole dinner 
get together was happening in the first place, it would be one of those 
rare times when all of them would be able to meet. Not including her 
father of course. It wasn't that Jo didn't like seeing her family, it could 
be quite fun sometimes but usually a member of the group would 
manage to accidentally bring up a topic related to why Cally was in 
prison in the first place. Jo knew her sister was getting better at 
controlling herself and in many ways she was proud that the 
rehabilitation was so effective but she still had a lot to work on. 
Ordinary prisons couldn't and wouldn't accept her, Cally attended 
somewhere special and it seemed to be helping. Anyways, any time that 
subject got brought up, well; let's just say the result last time hadn't 
been pretty. Cally was doing well, but when she exploded there was 
nothing within a ten mile radius that wasn't affected. It seemed that the 
bottle her father had given her wasn't a proper cure; it merely numbed 
her powers to a less dangerous, more manageable state. They were no 
longer fatal, but had grown up with her and that didn't stop them from 
causing damage. At least they were no longer boosted by the drugs 
Dolph had force fed to her once upon a time, Cally went quiet whenever 
he was brought up. She knew better than him now. But he'd been giving 
her the stuff long enough for it to have a lasting effect on her powers. 
So far, every time she got out on parole she would have one of her 
moments and get dragged back into the prison. It was clearly a painful 
process for her, so Jo had learnt to dread these days. 
	She shook her head in an attempt to rid herself of the memories 
and realised she was standing in front of her mother's front door. She 
felt a wave of nostalgia coming on and quickly knocked on the door 
before it could sweep through her.  Her mother opened the door almost 
instantly with a beaming look on her face. She looked happy, but Jo 
could simply not get used to the grey locks of hair that framed her face 
now.
"Jo it's so good to see you!" Aileen exclaimed giving her daughter a big 
hug. Jo was a little surprised but went with it. Her mother had changed 
a lot after her father died, she'd desperately tried to take over his job as 
the caring parent, but this willingness to hug was clearly a recent 
development. 
"Erm...it's good to see you too mum." Jo said.
Finally she let go.
"Come in, come in, it's freezing out there!"
Jo stepped into the hallway and shrugged off the snowflakes that rested 
on her shoulders. The place was just as she remembered it from her 
teenage years, although now the walls were painted a different shade 
of cream. She started to take off her coat.
"Is Cally here yet?"
"Yes, she was here early too!" Jo raised an eyebrow. "I know I wasn't 
expecting it either." Aileen admitted.
Jo placed her coat on the hanger, removed her shoes and let her mother 
lead her into the dining room. The table was decorated with tinsel, a 
miniature Christmas tree and a festive table cloth. 
"Wow mum, you've really gone all out this year!" Jo commented.
"Well, I thought we ought to celebrate."
Jo eyed the tree; it could very easily get in the way of conversation. In 
fact, that tree was the sole reason why she didn't spot her sister, as 
Cally was sitting directly behind it.
"Hi Jo." said Cally, startling her sister as she stood up.
"Hi Cal." Cally virtually skipped towards Jo and gave her a hug. Jo was 
shocked to say the least. Cally, like her mother, did not do hugs. "What's 
this for?"
Cally broke away.
"Didn't mum tell you?"
Cally's eyes sent daggers at Aileen.
"Don't look at me like that, I only found out when you arrived!" her 
mother protested.
"Tell me what?" asked Jo.
She was curious now, what with all the hugging.
"I am officially out of hell!" Cally announced.
"Huh?" Jo spluttered.
When was Cally in the afterlife in the first place?
"No going back to that prison, I'm free to go!"
Oh. She meant she was officially out of jail. That made a lot more sense. 
"So you've managed to control everything?" Jo double checked.
"Yeah! It's brilliant! Aren't you happy for me?"
Jo felt a smile start to stretch across her face to mirror the one on her 
sister's. She hadn't seen Cally this happy in a very long time. Ironically 
the last time she'd seen her like this was when she met Dolph. 
Everything had gone downhill from there, but now things were finally 
starting to look up.
"Of course I am, just a little surprised by all the hugging."
Aileen chuckled.
"Starting from now I'm going to be a new person. No more mistakes."
"Cally if you want to be a person you have to make a mistake from time 
to time." Jo reminded.
"Yeah I know. Just not a dangerous one this time round."
Jo sensed a hint of doubt in her sister's tone. She couldn't be unsure of 
herself, not after all she'd been through, all she'd managed to withhold.
"You won't." she reassured.
"I did before."
"It's not going to happen again." Jo put her hands on Cally's shoulders. 
"I trust you."

The End
